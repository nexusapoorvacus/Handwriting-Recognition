data/segments/a03/a03-011/a03-011-s00-02.png|the new and independent countries of Africa , that the
data/segments/a03/a03-011/a03-011-s00-03.png|time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
data/segments/a03/a03-011/a03-011-s00-04.png|the uncommitted countries and even to work out common

data/segments/a03/a03-017/a03-017-s00-01.png|the mission , but recent statements made by him
data/segments/a03/a03-017/a03-017-s00-02.png|in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
data/segments/a03/a03-017/a03-017-s00-03.png|himself as the only legal Prime Minister of

data/segments/a03/a03-017/a03-017-s01-01.png|to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though

data/segments/a03/a03-023/a03-023-s00-01.png|Government suggests that all is not well
data/segments/a03/a03-023/a03-023-s00-02.png|with the political and military leadership
data/segments/a03/a03-023/a03-023-s00-03.png|of the pro-communists .

data/segments/a03/a03-023/a03-023-s01-03.png|appear still to be firmly in their hands .
data/segments/a03/a03-023/a03-023-s02-00.png|The Government has claimed the

data/segments/a03/a03-027/a03-027-s01-04.png|some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958

data/segments/a03/a03-027/a03-027-s01-06.png|leader .
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s00-00.png|In some ways it will be a testing occasion
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s00-01.png|for him , although some think his position
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s00-02.png|unassailable simply because there is no one
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s00-03.png|else in sight to supplant him .
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s01-00.png|So the con-
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s01-01.png|ference will concentrate on laying the
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s01-02.png|foundations on which to win the next
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s01-03.png|election .
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s02-00.png|The rally comes at a time
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s02-01.png|when in spite of carefully worded state-
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s02-02.png|ments by the Prime Minister there is an
data/segments/a03/a03-030/a03-030-s02-03.png|air of electoral expectancy .
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s00-00.png|Members of the Cabinet are basing their speeches on
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s00-01.png|a new Conservative booklet called The Record Speaks
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s00-02.png|which outlines in some detail the accomplishments
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s00-03.png|of the party since it came to office three and
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s00-04.png|a half years ago .
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s01-00.png|Nevertheless there is little
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s01-01.png|illusion in the Conservative Party that their
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s01-02.png|stock at home has fallen in the face of
data/segments/a03/a03-034/a03-034-s01-03.png|heavy unemployment and an uncertain economy .
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s00-00.png|Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s00-01.png|provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s00-02.png|in the four federal by-elections last October the party
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s00-03.png|fared badly .
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s01-00.png|They are now faced with four other by-
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s01-01.png|elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia ,
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s01-02.png|one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s01-03.png|Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick ,
data/segments/a03/a03-037/a03-037-s01-04.png|and Kings , Prince Edward Island .
data/segments/a03/a03-040/a03-040-s00-00.png|All four were Conservative strongholds .
data/segments/a03/a03-040/a03-040-s01-00.png|Last September
data/segments/a03/a03-040/a03-040-s01-01.png|a public poll showed that for the first time since
data/segments/a03/a03-040/a03-040-s01-02.png|the Administration came to power in 1957 the
data/segments/a03/a03-040/a03-040-s01-03.png|Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour

data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s00-00.png|However , a separate poll revealed that Mr.
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s00-01.png|Diefenbaker was still ahead in terms of
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s00-02.png|popularity as an individual leader ( for
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s00-03.png|Mr. Diefenbaker 36 per cent , for Mr.
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s00-04.png|Pearson 34 per cent ) .
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s01-00.png|How far is Mr.
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s01-01.png|Lester Pearson acceptable to the people
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s01-02.png|of Canada as a Prime Minister ?
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s02-00.png|Many
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s02-01.png|observers at the national rally will be
data/segments/a03/a03-043/a03-043-s02-02.png|seeking an answer .
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s00-00.png|It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s00-01.png|in the role of a popular orator at the
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s00-02.png|hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s00-03.png|baker was in the last two campaigns .
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-01.png|impression remains that the Liberal leader
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-02.png|is still the diplomatist , more at home
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-03.png|in the chancery , or the corridors of the United
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-04.png|Nations , not the father figure , so necessary
data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-05.png|in Canadian leadership , or the practical

data/segments/a03/a03-047/a03-047-s01-07.png|in Algoma East .
data/segments/a03/a03-050/a03-050-s00-00.png|On the other hand , Mr. Pearson excels
data/segments/a03/a03-050/a03-050-s00-01.png|in meeting people informally , but many
data/segments/a03/a03-050/a03-050-s00-02.png|still regard him " as some sort of cross
data/segments/a03/a03-050/a03-050-s00-03.png|between an egghead and a missionary " .
data/segments/a03/a03-050/a03-050-s01-00.png|His party advisers are now trying to

data/segments/a03/a03-063/a03-063-s02-00.png|Stated more bluntly , they are still unconvinced that
data/segments/a03/a03-063/a03-063-s02-01.png|this is not primarily an effort on Britain's part to
data/segments/a03/a03-063/a03-063-s02-02.png|salve Blue Streak , which was abandoned last summer

data/segments/a03/a03-066/a03-066-s00-00.png|Mr. Thorneycroft's main purpose will be to
data/segments/a03/a03-066/a03-066-s00-01.png|remove these doubts , and to persuade the

data/segments/a03/a03-066/a03-066-s00-03.png|involved is really worth while , at a time when

data/segments/a03/a03-066/a03-066-s00-05.png|would almost certainly involve a corresponding

data/segments/a03/a03-071/a03-071-s00-00.png|But , at the same time , there is reason to
data/segments/a03/a03-071/a03-071-s00-01.png|believe that the Federal Government is not

data/segments/a03/a03-080/a03-080-s01-01.png|to German participation is the absence of

data/segments/a04/a04-043/a04-043-s02-00.png|His main theme was that nuclear
data/segments/a04/a04-043/a04-043-s02-01.png|weapons were necessary to defend Britain , that
data/segments/a04/a04-043/a04-043-s02-02.png|Britain must depend on Nato and " the West "
data/segments/a04/a04-043/a04-043-s02-03.png|must have nuclear weapons so long as the
data/segments/a04/a04-043/a04-043-s02-04.png|Soviet Union has them .

data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s00-01.png|of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s00-02.png|sure the Labour movement was coming round in
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s00-03.png|support of his views .
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s01-00.png|Obviously conscious of the fierce and
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s01-01.png|widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s01-02.png|Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s01-03.png|supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s01-04.png|their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
data/segments/a04/a04-047/a04-047-s01-05.png|to the missile .
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s00-00.png|Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s00-01.png|not deny facilities to nations to which it was
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s00-02.png|allied .
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s01-00.png|But governments should be free to negotiate
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s01-01.png|and refuse proposals with which they did not
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s01-02.png|agree .
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s02-00.png|The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s02-01.png|he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and
data/segments/a04/a04-050/a04-050-s02-02.png|would attract enemy action .
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s00-00.png|That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s01-00.png|So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s01-01.png|the West , somewhere , must have them too .
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s02-00.png|It
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s02-01.png|was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s02-02.png|purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s03-00.png|This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
data/segments/a04/a04-054/a04-054-s03-01.png|to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
data/segments/a04/a04-059/a04-059-s00-00.png|The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
data/segments/a04/a04-059/a04-059-s00-01.png|in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a

data/segments/a04/a04-059/a04-059-s01-00.png|It should be sited

data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s00-00.png|Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s00-01.png|unilateralists was not possible , though
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s00-02.png|he respected their views .
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-00.png|He saw by reports
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-01.png|that " those who organise these things " were
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-02.png|recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-03.png|disarmament to shift the emphasis of
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-04.png|their intervention away from straight opposition
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-05.png|to the official document on to opposition
data/segments/a04/a04-066/a04-066-s01-06.png|to the Polaris base .
data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s00-00.png|To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the
data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s00-01.png|Prime Minister should begin to take
data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s00-02.png|seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s00-03.png|weapons within the Nato alliance .
data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s01-00.png|" Let us say
data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s01-01.png|to Macmillan that he should press , I hope

data/segments/a04/a04-069/a04-069-s01-03.png|talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment

data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s00-00.png|He thought , he said , that the Soviet
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s00-01.png|Union would be prepared to reach
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s00-02.png|an agreement on a zone of controlled

data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s01-01.png|concluded , declaring that the present
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s01-02.png|was the beginning of a great period of
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s01-03.png|opportunity for the party .
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s02-00.png|It was a
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s02-01.png|great chance that should be grasped .
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s03-00.png|Inter-union jealousies prevent the
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s03-01.png|fulfilment of a common policy for wages
data/segments/a04/a04-072/a04-072-s03-02.png|and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s00-00.png|The General Council of the Trades Union
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s00-01.png|Congress should therefore consider the
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s00-02.png|matter .
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s01-00.png|Consideration should also be given
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s01-01.png|to the regrouping of unions and the
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s01-02.png|modification of their structures to

data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s02-00.png|Mr. Cooper argued that a
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s02-01.png|common industrial contribution was
data/segments/a04/a04-081/a04-081-s02-02.png|urgent - particularly in unions serving

data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s00-03.png|argued that the position needed examination .

data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s01-01.png|Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s01-02.png|the views of a wide section of the
data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s01-03.png|British people about Polaris submarine
data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s01-04.png|bases in this country .
data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s02-00.png|An open letter
data/segments/a04/a04-085/a04-085-s02-01.png|written by Earl Russell hoping that the

data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s00-01.png|of 100 , told Kennedy that he should
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s00-02.png|take notice of " that very large and
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s00-03.png|growing section which is opposed to
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s00-04.png|the establishment of a Polaris base ,
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s00-05.png|whether at Holy Loch or elsewhere on
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s00-06.png|British territory . "
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s01-00.png|He pointed out that
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s01-01.png|already there have been protests but
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s01-02.png|that " very much larger protests are to
data/segments/a04/a04-089/a04-089-s01-03.png|be expected and are being planned . "
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s00-00.png|There are three kinds of reasons that justify
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s00-01.png|the protests and these should carry weight with
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s00-02.png|the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested .
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s01-00.png|" The
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s01-01.png|first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s01-02.png|serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s01-03.png|U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s01-04.png|circles , but in public opinion . "
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s02-00.png|Earl Russell
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s02-01.png|says it is inevitable , though profoundly
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s02-02.png|regrettable , that the agitation against
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s02-03.png|the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
data/segments/a04/a04-092/a04-092-s02-04.png|to the policy of the United States .
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s00-00.png|The second reason is concerned with doubts
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s00-01.png|as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s00-02.png|" in the time of crisis it would probably be
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s00-03.png|impossible for the British authorities to
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s00-04.png|exercise any degree of control over the action
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s00-05.png|of Polaris submarines . "
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s01-00.png|He argues that
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s01-01.png|there is a distinct possibility that so long
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s01-02.png|as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s01-03.png|Soviet Union might retaliate against
data/segments/a04/a04-096/a04-096-s01-04.png|Britain alone .
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s00-00.png|" Such retaliation might , and probably would ,
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s00-01.png|destroy the whole population of Britain in
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s00-02.png|the course of , at the most , an hour " without
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s00-03.png|provoking American retaliation .
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s01-00.png|Earl Russell
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s01-01.png|believes :
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s02-00.png|" It is very questionable whether
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s02-01.png|British membership of Nato and British

data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s02-03.png|add anything to the strength of America ,
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s02-04.png|while , on the contrary , they impose upon
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s02-05.png|America an onerous obligation which it
data/segments/a04/a04-099/a04-099-s02-06.png|may prove impossible to fulfil . "
data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s00-00.png|The third reason is that the supreme
data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s00-01.png|interest for the whole world - East and
data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s00-02.png|West and uncommitted nations - is the
data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s00-03.png|prevention of nuclear war .

data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s01-02.png|believes that Britain could be more effective
data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s01-03.png|in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
data/segments/a04/a04-103/a04-103-s01-04.png|by helping to suggest agreements which could

data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s00-00.png|THE next White Paper on defence , to
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s00-01.png|be published in March , is likely to
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s00-02.png|contain a five-year plan for the three
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s00-03.png|Services .
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s01-00.png|Its aim will be to produce superbly
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s01-01.png|equipped , all-Regular forces of
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s01-02.png|about 400,000 men .
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s02-00.png|The three Services
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s02-01.png|would be " integrated " to a greater
data/segments/a05/a05-000/a05-000-s02-02.png|extent than ever before .
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s00-00.png|Short of wearing the same uniform , which is

data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s00-02.png|Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s00-03.png|a single defence force .
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s01-00.png|There would be
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s01-01.png|complete co-operation at all levels in training
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s01-02.png|and operations .
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s02-00.png|This would apply also in the
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s02-01.png|command structure and central administrative
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s02-02.png|organisation .
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s03-00.png|Mr. Watkinson , Minister of Defence ,
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s03-01.png|has been working on the plan for some months ,
data/segments/a05/a05-004/a05-004-s03-02.png|with the Prime Minister's approval .
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s00-00.png|He has had numerous meetings with the Service
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s00-01.png|Ministers .
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s01-00.png|He has also had talks with the Earl

data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s01-03.png|of defence policy .
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s02-00.png|Details of the scheme
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s02-01.png|are now being worked out by the Chiefs
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s02-02.png|of Staff , a process that may take four
data/segments/a05/a05-009/a05-009-s02-03.png|or five months .
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s00-00.png|The scheme will be subject to Cabinet
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s00-01.png|approval .
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s01-00.png|Mr. Watkinson remains con-
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s01-01.png|vinced that the policy initiated in
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s01-02.png|1957 , in Mr. Sandys's time as Minister
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s01-03.png|of Defence , is still correct .
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s02-00.png|This was to
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s02-01.png|return to the tradition of all-Regular
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s02-02.png|voluntary forces , with the last National
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s02-03.png|Serviceman out of uniform by the end
data/segments/a05/a05-013/a05-013-s02-04.png|of 1962 .
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s00-00.png|The Minister regards the recent trend
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s00-01.png|of recruiting figures as encouraging .
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s01-00.png|He is confident the aim can be achieved .
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s02-00.png|While the possibility of an eventual return
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s02-01.png|to National Service in some form
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s02-02.png|cannot be entirely discounted , he does
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s02-03.png|not agree that the point has been reached
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s02-04.png|where this need even be considered .
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s03-00.png|If
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s03-01.png|National Service is ever resorted to ,
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s03-02.png|engagement would probably have to be for
data/segments/a05/a05-017/a05-017-s03-03.png|three years .
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s00-00.png|It is thought this would be the minimum
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s00-01.png|necessary for the extended training modern
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s00-02.png|arms require and to enable each man to
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s00-03.png|serve at least a year overseas .
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s01-00.png|There is
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s01-01.png|no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s01-02.png|is at odds with the Service chiefs over
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s01-03.png|the decision to dispense with National
data/segments/a05/a05-022/a05-022-s01-04.png|Service , or over any other aspect of

data/segments/a05/a05-025/a05-025-s00-00.png|Criticisms about Army manpower appear
data/segments/a05/a05-025/a05-025-s00-01.png|to have come mainly from retired officers

data/segments/a05/a05-025/a05-025-s00-03.png|are out of touch with the existing situation .
data/segments/a05/a05-025/a05-025-s01-00.png|Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support

data/segments/a05/a05-029/a05-029-s01-01.png|September , was delayed because of the

data/segments/a05/a05-048/a05-048-s03-00.png|THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
data/segments/a05/a05-048/a05-048-s03-01.png|last night that he had considered early
data/segments/a05/a05-048/a05-048-s03-02.png|in the Parliamentary recess whether to
data/segments/a05/a05-048/a05-048-s03-03.png|mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
data/segments/a05/a05-048/a05-048-s03-04.png|British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s00-00.png|He decided that it would be a great error
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s00-01.png|to do so and to recall Parliament .
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s01-00.png|But
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s01-01.png|there would be no hesitation in mobilising

data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s01-03.png|warranted such a step .
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s02-00.png|It would have to be
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s02-01.png|accompanied by other measures of a military ,

data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s03-03.png|be party to accepting as a matter of
data/segments/a05/a05-053/a05-053-s03-04.png|principle the imposed division of Germany .

data/segments/a05/a05-058/a05-058-s01-01.png|Minister of State , Foreign Office , said
data/segments/a05/a05-058/a05-058-s01-02.png|earlier that the Government had asked

data/segments/a05/a05-058/a05-058-s02-00.png|The Council's findings would be
data/segments/a05/a05-058/a05-058-s02-01.png|made public .
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-00.png|With a vigour and authority which delighted
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-01.png|old Parliamentary friends and foes alike ,
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-02.png|the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-03.png|Eden , in his maiden speech in the House
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-04.png|of Lords last night , gave a warning
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-05.png|that # appeasement over Berlin could
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s00-06.png|only lead to war .
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s01-00.png|To stand firm , he
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s01-01.png|declared , was not to invite war , but
data/segments/a05/a05-062/a05-062-s01-02.png|the surest way to avert it .
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s00-00.png|It was the end of a rather curious
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s00-01.png|speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s00-02.png|the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s01-00.png|He began in a low , almost chatty mono-
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s01-01.png|tone , and his voice never rose to any
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s01-02.png|accent of urgency .
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s02-00.png|He passed in rapid
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s02-01.png|review the United Nations Secretariat ;
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s02-02.png|nuclear tests ; the canard about British
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s02-03.png|interference with the United Nations
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s02-04.png|in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
data/segments/a05/a05-069/a05-069-s02-05.png|Asia .
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s00-00.png|He spent most of his short half-hour on
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s00-01.png|Berlin .
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s01-00.png|He deplored the possibility of
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s01-01.png|some " new myth " about betrayal of Germany
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s01-02.png|by the Allies .
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s02-00.png|" We do not , " he said , " really
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s02-01.png|know what the Russians want . "
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s03-00.png|But he was
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s03-01.png|certain that they wanted to establish a
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s03-02.png|final and irrevocable division of Germany .
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s04-00.png|Britain could not be a party to an imposed
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s04-01.png|division .
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s05-00.png|But negotiation , as the debate had
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s05-01.png|shown , could be undertaken on a variety
data/segments/a05/a05-073/a05-073-s05-02.png|of bases .
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s00-00.png|Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s00-01.png|ately refrained during the summer from
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s00-02.png|recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s00-03.png|by proclamation , such as would be
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s00-04.png|necessary to bring the British Army of the Rhine
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s00-05.png|on to a fully active footing .
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s01-00.png|That
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s01-01.png|would have created a thoroughly unde-
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s01-02.png|sirable atmosphere of panic .
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s02-00.png|He thought
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s02-01.png|that the situation was rather more
data/segments/a05/a05-080/a05-080-s02-02.png|hopeful .
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s00-00.png|The Russians now realised its seriousness .
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s01-01.png|French doubts were more about procedure
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s01-02.png|than about substance .
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s02-00.png|The Prime Minister's
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s02-01.png|attitude of studied calm brought down the
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s02-02.png|temperature of the debate , which never
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s02-03.png|at any time rose to fever pitch , to a
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s02-04.png|remarkable degree of sub-normality .
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s03-00.png|Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s03-01.png|of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening
data/segments/a05/a05-084/a05-084-s03-02.png|in the Peers' Gallery .
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s00-00.png|The early speakers in the debate each
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s00-01.png|severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s01-00.png|These strictures were all too well justified .
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s02-00.png|We started with the plaintive wailings
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s02-01.png|of Mr. Healey , " Shadow " Foreign Secretary ,

data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s03-00.png|In turn , Mr. Godber was
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s03-01.png|censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour
data/segments/a05/a05-089/a05-089-s03-02.png|Defence Minister , for having read the
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s00-00.png|The trouble about such debates is that
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s00-01.png|they range too widely .
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s01-00.png|They remind one of
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s01-01.png|the Rugby match in " Tom Brown's Schooldays , "
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s01-02.png|in which all the boys were welcome to
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s01-03.png|take part , and only those who " really meant
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s01-04.png|business " removed their jackets .
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s02-00.png|Not many
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s02-01.png|metaphorical braces were visible in the
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s02-02.png|early stages of to-night's debate .
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s03-00.png|Mr.
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s03-01.png|Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s03-02.png|golf-course Press conference , which he
data/segments/a05/a05-094/a05-094-s03-03.png|described as " a display of flabby and
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s00-00.png|A reference to the reunification of Germany
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s00-01.png|brought a bark of " Start another war ! "
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s00-02.png|from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) .
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s01-00.png|Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s01-01.png|theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s02-00.png|This could , he suggested , be linked with
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s02-01.png|prohibition of the production of atomic
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s02-02.png|weapons in any part of Europe .

data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s03-01.png|and control would be much easier to
data/segments/a05/a05-099/a05-099-s03-02.png|establish in these territories .
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s00-00.png|Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s00-01.png|using double standards .
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s01-00.png|Ministers had
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s01-01.png|rebuked the unaligned nations for not
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s01-02.png|condemning the new Russian tests , but
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s01-03.png|they themselves had no condemnation for
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s01-04.png|events in Angola or Algeria .
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s02-00.png|It was not for
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s02-01.png|the Government , said Mr. Healey , to
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s02-02.png|take up moral attitudes , " especially when
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s02-03.png|the temple of their religion is the
data/segments/a05/a05-104/a05-104-s02-04.png|bingo-parlour . "
data/segments/a05/a05-108/a05-108-s00-00.png|This puzzled such students of comparative
data/segments/a05/a05-108/a05-108-s00-01.png|religion as had failed to detect this cult .
data/segments/a05/a05-108/a05-108-s01-00.png|But Mr. Healey had a partial and
data/segments/a05/a05-108/a05-108-s01-01.png|limited success .
data/segments/a05/a05-108/a05-108-s02-00.png|He rallied behind him
data/segments/a05/a05-108/a05-108-s02-01.png|the Left-wing opinion so coolly snubbed last

data/segments/b01/b01-118/b01-118-s02-00.png|It was Dr. Verwoerd who

data/segments/b01/b01-118/b01-118-s02-02.png|because they would " defile " the national

data/segments/b01/b01-127/b01-127-s02-00.png|THERE is no evidence that the

data/segments/b01/b01-127/b01-127-s03-00.png|On the contrary ,
data/segments/b01/b01-127/b01-127-s03-01.png|apartheid is being applied ever more

data/segments/b01/b01-132/b01-132-s01-00.png|It may be that the Commonwealth

data/segments/b02/b02-035/b02-035-s00-03.png|a means not to destruction but to safety .

data/segments/b02/b02-035/b02-035-s01-01.png|on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,

data/segments/b02/b02-045/b02-045-s00-00.png|Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make
data/segments/b02/b02-045/b02-045-s00-01.png|this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it
data/segments/b02/b02-045/b02-045-s00-02.png|very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original

data/segments/b02/b02-102/b02-102-s00-00.png|To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
data/segments/b02/b02-102/b02-102-s00-01.png|millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their

data/segments/b02/b02-102/b02-102-s00-03.png|the Berlin crisis .
data/segments/b02/b02-102/b02-102-s01-00.png|It need not have been such a burden

data/segments/b03/b03-025/b03-025-s00-00.png|But discussion on current points of east-west con-
data/segments/b03/b03-025/b03-025-s00-01.png|flict could not go much farther than , for example , the

data/segments/b03/b03-025/b03-025-s00-03.png|cannot be followed together .
data/segments/b03/b03-025/b03-025-s01-00.png|What the council has done -
data/segments/b03/b03-025/b03-025-s01-01.png|and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-

data/segments/b03/b03-087/b03-087-s03-00.png|This fact may give

data/segments/b03/b03-114/b03-114-s02-00.png|That effort was to enforce

data/segments/d01/d01-024/d01-024-s00-00.png|Most of those who expound a theory of textual
data/segments/d01/d01-024/d01-024-s00-01.png|dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was

data/segments/d01/d01-049/d01-049-s01-01.png|this is possible it is necessary to examine the
data/segments/d01/d01-049/d01-049-s01-02.png|text of the Gospel .
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s00-00.png|THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s00-01.png|written in Greek .
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s01-00.png|A modern text of the
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s01-01.png|Gospel represents the work of generations of
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s01-02.png|scholars who have compared the many manu-
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s01-03.png|scripts of John and worked out the version
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s01-04.png|which is most likely to have been the original
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s01-05.png|wording .
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s02-00.png|It is not possible to establish any one
data/segments/d01/d01-052/d01-052-s02-01.png|text with absolute precision .
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s00-00.png|The most convenient one for the authors
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s00-01.png|has been the text of A. Souter .
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s01-00.png|In this
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s01-01.png|version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s01-02.png|printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s01-03.png|verbs , and other parts of speech occurring
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s01-04.png|15,695 times in their different grammatical
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s01-05.png|forms .
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s02-00.png|There are other texts which could
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s02-01.png|have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s02-02.png|it is not a matter of the greatest importance
data/segments/d01/d01-056/d01-056-s02-03.png|which text is used .
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s00-00.png|At first sight the difference between
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s00-01.png|Souter and the other texts is rather
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s00-02.png|large .
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s01-00.png|But the British text includes
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s01-01.png|the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s01-02.png|taken in Adultery , and this accounts
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s01-03.png|for 178 words out of 279 , which is
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s01-04.png|the difference between the 15,695 words
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s01-05.png|of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's .
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s02-00.png|The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
data/segments/d01/d01-060/d01-060-s02-01.png|is a matter of editorial decision rather
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s00-00.png|The bar was the commonest marking , but others
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s00-01.png|were also used .
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s01-00.png|Dots sometimes served in place of the
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s01-01.png|bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s01-02.png|it is now used to mark a paragraph ending .
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s02-00.png|Frequently
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s02-01.png|paragraphos markings were omitted .
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s03-00.png|C. H. Roberts is of
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s03-01.png|the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s03-02.png|some markings would be used , although which , it is
data/segments/d01/d01-080/d01-080-s03-03.png|impossible to say .
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s00-00.png|Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take the view that
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s00-01.png|the original of the Gospel would be unmarked .
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s01-01.png|original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s01-02.png|whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s01-03.png|columns .
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s02-00.png|This is the invariable practice of ancient
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s02-01.png|manuscripts .
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s03-00.png|A common size of column would hold
data/segments/d01/d01-085/d01-085-s03-01.png|about one third of a page of Souter's print .
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s00-00.png|The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s00-01.png|and the sheet wound round this central pin .
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s01-00.png|The roll made
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s01-01.png|a simple and serviceable book .
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s02-00.png|It was robust - the number
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s02-01.png|which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s02-02.png|this - and it was easily stored .
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s03-00.png|It had two disadvantages .
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s04-00.png|It
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s04-01.png|was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s04-02.png|an easy form of book in which to find a
data/segments/d01/d01-098/d01-098-s04-03.png|reference .
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s00-00.png|This last objection might have had some weight in
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s00-01.png|ecclesiastical circles .
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s01-00.png|In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s01-01.png|the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s02-00.png|As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s02-01.png|overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s02-02.png|information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s03-00.png|The other form of book was the codex .
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s04-00.png|In this the
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s04-01.png|sheets were bound together down one edge much as
data/segments/d01/d01-104/d01-104-s04-02.png|they are in modern books .
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s00-00.png|Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s00-01.png|might be bulky .
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s01-00.png|It is sometimes possible to tell
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s01-01.png|whether or not a particular text was written on
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s01-02.png|a roll or a codex .
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s02-00.png|Rolls were prepared for
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s02-01.png|writing , but any papyrus left unused at the
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s02-02.png|end could be cut off .
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s03-00.png|If the text was longer than
data/segments/d01/d01-118/d01-118-s03-01.png|the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on .
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s00-00.png|The verso of the roll was blank , and one
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s00-01.png|cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s00-02.png|sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s00-03.png|while one whole side of his roll was unused .
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s01-00.png|The codex form was not so accommodating .
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s02-00.png|Even
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s02-01.png|in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s02-02.png|sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
data/segments/d01/d01-123/d01-123-s02-03.png|over the binding , or the whole codex rebound .

data/segments/d05/d05-025/d05-025-s03-02.png|became the foster mother of some of the most

data/segments/d05/d05-030/d05-030-s00-01.png|now so much nobler a figure than former historians
data/segments/d05/d05-030/d05-030-s00-02.png|led us to believe .
data/segments/d05/d05-030/d05-030-s01-00.png|Laud was enthusiastically hated

data/segments/d05/d05-030/d05-030-s02-00.png|But Laud was no Romanizer .

data/segments/d05/d05-040/d05-040-s01-00.png|Laud made a positive approach .
data/segments/d05/d05-040/d05-040-s02-00.png|He set out to increase
data/segments/d05/d05-040/d05-040-s02-01.png|a sense of reverence .
data/segments/d05/d05-040/d05-040-s03-00.png|The Prayer Book was to be respected
data/segments/d05/d05-040/d05-040-s03-01.png|and so was the office of a bishop .
data/segments/d05/d05-040/d05-040-s04-00.png|Altars should be

data/segments/d06/d06-000/d06-000-s01-04.png|up either for the sham it is - and many
data/segments/d06/d06-000/d06-000-s01-05.png|fears are based upon completely
data/segments/d06/d06-000/d06-000-s01-06.png|irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
data/segments/d06/d06-003/d06-003-s00-00.png|Even worse is to laugh .

data/segments/d06/d06-003/d06-003-s03-00.png|Not that I am suggesting
data/segments/d06/d06-003/d06-003-s03-01.png|that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made

data/segments/d06/d06-008/d06-008-s00-03.png|the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,
data/segments/d06/d06-008/d06-008-s00-04.png|the harvest of which may still be being
data/segments/d06/d06-008/d06-008-s00-05.png|reaped at forty or fifty .
data/segments/d06/d06-008/d06-008-s01-00.png|Far better to
data/segments/d06/d06-008/d06-008-s01-01.png|agree with a child that a particular

data/segments/d06/d06-011/d06-011-s00-00.png|Because situations which may contain

data/segments/d06/d06-011/d06-011-s00-02.png|it is a good idea to condition a child

data/segments/d06/d06-020/d06-020-s03-00.png|More than that , that God
data/segments/d06/d06-020/d06-020-s03-01.png|has something important to do with our

data/segments/d06/d06-020/d06-020-s03-03.png|the stronger we become .

data/segments/d06/d06-027/d06-027-s01-03.png|be really afraid , help us to know that when
data/segments/d06/d06-027/d06-027-s01-04.png|we face life boldly , many of the shadows are
data/segments/d06/d06-027/d06-027-s01-05.png|seen to be allies and not enemies and that ,
data/segments/d06/d06-027/d06-027-s01-06.png|come what may , we are never alone when
data/segments/d06/d06-027/d06-027-s01-07.png|we are with Thee .

data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s01-00.png|MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s01-01.png|purely physical thing .
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s02-00.png|The cure for which is sleep .
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s03-00.png|This is only
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s03-01.png|partly true .
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s04-00.png|Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s04-01.png|amount of rest seems to make any difference .
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s05-00.png|Sleep , to be
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s05-01.png|effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes
data/segments/d06/d06-030/d06-030-s05-02.png|from innocence .
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s00-00.png|To others , the long hours of the night bring
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s00-01.png|only a disturbed tossing and turning
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s00-02.png|which causes them to wake feeling worse
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s00-03.png|than when they went to bed .
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s01-00.png|We may begin
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s01-01.png|to understand this a little better when we
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s01-02.png|realize that tiredness itself is largely in
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s01-03.png|the mind .
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s02-00.png|Very few people , under normal
data/segments/d06/d06-037/d06-037-s02-01.png|conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s00-00.png|The mind tires first and conveys the impression
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s00-01.png|of tiredness to the body .
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s01-00.png|This can be proved by
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s01-01.png|noting the effect of a new stimulus on some-
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s01-02.png|body who feels thoroughly tired .
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s02-00.png|Suppose
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s02-01.png|a mother has news late at night that her
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s02-02.png|child is in danger .
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s03-00.png|She will undertake a
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s03-01.png|journey which , an hour before , she would
data/segments/d06/d06-041/d06-041-s03-02.png|have declared impossible .
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s00-00.png|Even more simply , test your own reactions
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s00-01.png|to different situations .
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s01-00.png|There are some which
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s01-01.png|bring on an almost immediate feeling of
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s01-02.png|tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s01-03.png|the washing-up - while others , if they
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s01-04.png|refer to something you like doing , bring a
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s01-05.png|veritable surge of energy .
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s02-00.png|Many a girl who
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s02-01.png|is ' too tired to help mum ' will later jump
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s02-02.png|up with no apparent tiredness at all when
data/segments/d06/d06-046/d06-046-s02-03.png|her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s00-00.png|Nor is she necessarily being deceitful .
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s01-00.png|She really did feel tired
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s01-01.png|until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s01-02.png|attractive - interest !
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s02-00.png|Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s02-01.png|with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion .
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s03-00.png|A
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s03-01.png|disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s03-02.png|of fatigue .
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s04-00.png|They wonder why they get no rest at night ,
data/segments/d06/d06-050/d06-050-s04-01.png|even if they do sleep .
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s00-00.png|They drag themselves around and can become
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s00-01.png|a burden to their families and their friends .
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s01-00.png|Any mental confusion can cause this and
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s01-01.png|the best way is probably to seek advice .
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s02-00.png|As we are unable to cure our own bodies
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s02-01.png|if the cause of our pain is too deep seated ,
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s02-02.png|so we are unable to cure our own minds ,
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s02-03.png|if the trouble is a complicated one
data/segments/d06/d06-056/d06-056-s02-04.png|involving careful and patient treatment .
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s00-00.png|One of the greatest steps forward that has been
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s00-01.png|made this century is the way in which illness
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s00-02.png|of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s00-03.png|and is in fact no differently regarded than
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s00-04.png|physical illness .
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s01-00.png|There is , nevertheless , a
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s01-01.png|great deal of tiredness which comes from
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s01-02.png|no major complication but results from an
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s01-03.png|inability to deal with life , especially under
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s01-04.png|the diverse pattern which is the twentieth
data/segments/d06/d06-060/d06-060-s01-05.png|century .
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s00-00.png|In the days when most people were born ,
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s00-01.png|lived and died within the boundaries of
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s00-02.png|the village , it was not difficult for anybody
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s00-03.png|to live a day at a time .
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s01-00.png|Even those who
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s01-01.png|held a high and responsible office lived in
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s01-02.png|far greater simplicity than their successors .
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s02-00.png|When news from the Continent took days ,
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s02-01.png|from America weeks , from the Far East ,
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s02-02.png|months , even a Prime Minister could go to
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s02-03.png|sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
data/segments/d06/d06-063/d06-063-s02-04.png|be happening at the other end of England ,
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s00-00.png|In other ways , too , life for the ordinary
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s00-01.png|individual has become so complex
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s00-02.png|that it taxes the mind .
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s01-00.png|Two hundred
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s01-01.png|years ago , men lived and worked

data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s01-03.png|piece .

data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s03-00.png|The only connexion is the
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s03-01.png|pipeline of the railway on which they
data/segments/d06/d06-067/d06-067-s03-02.png|travel day by day .
data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s00-00.png|In many cases , their homes know little of

data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s00-04.png|homes .
data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s01-00.png|It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s01-01.png|a ' double ' life without ever deliberately

data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s02-00.png|It is easier to live life in

data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s02-02.png|and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
data/segments/d06/d06-072/d06-072-s02-03.png|need to be handled correctly .
data/segments/d06/d06-076/d06-076-s00-00.png|Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life

data/segments/d06/d06-082/d06-082-s00-00.png|If we ever stopped to consider how much energy - and time -

data/segments/e01/e01-035/e01-035-s00-04.png|boys as well .
data/segments/e01/e01-035/e01-035-s01-00.png|Whole families made their
data/segments/e01/e01-035/e01-035-s01-01.png|livelihood by lace-making and consequently
data/segments/e01/e01-035/e01-035-s01-02.png|a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew
data/segments/e01/e01-035/e01-035-s01-03.png|up around the lace industry .
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s00-00.png|During the sixteenth century a considerable
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s00-01.png|amount of crochet was produced in the
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s00-02.png|convents of Europe .
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s01-00.png|Without doubt it was the
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s01-01.png|nuns who carried the craft to Ireland .
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s02-00.png|There it
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s02-01.png|was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s02-02.png|form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings .
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s03-00.png|During
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s03-01.png|the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
data/segments/e01/e01-050/e01-050-s03-02.png|greatly abused .
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s00-00.png|One can remember with horror the pictures of the
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s00-01.png|overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms

data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s01-00.png|It was some years
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s01-01.png|after the Victorian period that designers realised
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s01-02.png|the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s01-03.png|revived with designs suitable for contemporary
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s01-04.png|trends .
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s02-00.png|Crochet today has a variety of uses , and
data/segments/e01/e01-055/e01-055-s02-01.png|has even stepped into the field of high fashion .

data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s00-00.png|In the home , crochet lace can be used to make
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s00-01.png|tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s00-02.png|from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s00-03.png|functions .
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s01-00.png|The art of crochet is not difficult and
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s01-01.png|it is reasonably quick to work .
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s02-00.png|In the following
data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s02-01.png|pages simple diagrams and instructions are given

data/segments/e01/e01-062/e01-062-s02-03.png|crochet stitches .
data/segments/e01/e01-081/e01-081-s00-00.png|First launder crochet and then pin to the required
data/segments/e01/e01-081/e01-081-s00-01.png|shape , ensuring that all lines of the crochet are
data/segments/e01/e01-081/e01-081-s00-02.png|accurate .
data/segments/e01/e01-081/e01-081-s01-00.png|Place crochet in correct position on linen and

data/segments/e01/e01-081/e01-081-s03-00.png|Remove crochet .
data/segments/e01/e01-086/e01-086-s00-00.png|Two methods can be used to join the crochet to the linen :
data/segments/e01/e01-086/e01-086-s01-00.png|( a ) Button Stitch round the outline of basting stitches ,

data/segments/e01/e01-092/e01-092-s03-02.png|thickness - it is the ideal crochet thread .
data/segments/e01/e01-102/e01-102-s00-00.png|Remember that texture plays an important part in
data/segments/e01/e01-102/e01-102-s00-01.png|the beauty of crochet .
data/segments/e01/e01-102/e01-102-s01-00.png|The finer mercerised threads
data/segments/e01/e01-102/e01-102-s01-01.png|are more effective for the delicate designs used for
data/segments/e01/e01-102/e01-102-s01-02.png|tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while
data/segments/e01/e01-102/e01-102-s01-03.png|the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,

data/segments/e01/e01-107/e01-107-s04-03.png|from the directions included in this book .
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s00-00.png|1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s00-01.png|and forefinger .
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s01-00.png|2 . Make a loop by
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s01-01.png|lapping long thread over short thread .
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s02-00.png|3 . Hold loop in place between thumb
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s02-01.png|and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) .
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s03-00.png|1 . Take hold
data/segments/e01/e01-113/e01-113-s03-01.png|of broad bar of hook as you would a

data/segments/e01/e01-119/e01-119-s04-00.png|Pull short end and ball thread
data/segments/e01/e01-119/e01-119-s04-01.png|in opposite directions to bring loop close around

data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s00-00.png|A great deal of modern furniture has tapered
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s00-01.png|legs , and in reproduction period pieces they
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s00-02.png|are frequently used .
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s01-00.png|The simpler varieties are
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s01-01.png|extremely easy to work , the four sides being
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s01-02.png|simply planed to give the required taper .
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s02-00.png|In
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s02-01.png|the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s02-02.png|worked in the solid , and this certainly
data/segments/e02/e02-000/e02-000-s02-03.png|complicates the operation .
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s00-00.png|For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s01-00.png|The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s01-01.png|on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s01-02.png|as before .
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s02-00.png|It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s02-01.png|the straight-edge as one relies upon the truth
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s02-02.png|of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
data/segments/e02/e02-014/e02-014-s02-03.png|straight .
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s00-00.png|A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s00-01.png|end reveals when the required amount
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s00-02.png|has been removed , and if care is taken
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s00-03.png|to stop the plane short of the squared
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s00-04.png|pencil line at the top , the work will be
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s00-05.png|accurate .
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s01-00.png|The straight-edge can be used
data/segments/e02/e02-018/e02-018-s01-01.png|to test the straightness of the sides .
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s00-00.png|Incidentally , it is better to
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s00-01.png|complete any mortising that may be
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s00-02.png|needed at the top before the tapering is
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s00-03.png|begun .
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s01-00.png|Some plain tapered legs have
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s01-01.png|the taper on the two inner faces only ,
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s01-02.png|the outer surfaces being vertical as
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s01-03.png|at ( B ) , Fig. 1 .
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s02-00.png|To make a leg such as
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s02-01.png|that at ( D ) , Fig. 1 , the square is first
data/segments/e02/e02-021/e02-021-s02-02.png|marked out as at ( A ) , Fig. 3 .
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-00.png|Note that squared lines marking
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-01.png|the top member of the toe are
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-02.png|needed as well as the upper ex-
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-03.png|tent of the taper , and in
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-04.png|this case it is necessary to
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-05.png|mark in the line of the taper
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-06.png|with pencil and straight-edge
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s00-07.png|as at ( B ) , Fig. 3 .
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s01-00.png|A saw cut is
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s01-01.png|made at the upper toe line
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s01-02.png|exactly down to the taper line ,
data/segments/e02/e02-025/e02-025-s01-03.png|no farther .
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s00-00.png|But why woodwork in particular ?
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s01-00.png|Well , there
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s01-01.png|are many reasons .
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-00.png|Wood is in good and
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-01.png|common supply ; it lends itself to making
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-02.png|innumerable useful household items -
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-03.png|furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-04.png|it enables results to be obtained fairly
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-05.png|quickly ; it is less expensive than most
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-06.png|other materials ; it is a pleasant material
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-07.png|to work with ; and , although it does
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-08.png|create a certain amount of mess , it is
data/segments/e02/e02-074/e02-074-s02-09.png|all clean and easily cleared away .
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s00-00.png|This last point is certainly important because almost
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s00-01.png|everyone has come to recognise that machines
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s00-02.png|are not only an economic necessity , but that a
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s00-03.png|great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s00-04.png|installation of a power tool .
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s01-00.png|As an elementary
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s01-01.png|example , surely no one can pretend to enjoy
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s01-02.png|ripping out parts from hardwood .
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s02-00.png|Most men
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s02-01.png|would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
data/segments/e02/e02-082/e02-082-s02-02.png|were available .
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s00-00.png|Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s00-01.png|with what we have called a bare minimum kit .
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s01-00.png|Probably
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s01-01.png|most men have some of the tools already .
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s02-00.png|It will enable
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s02-01.png|a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s02-02.png|any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s02-03.png|which other tools can be added as the need arises .
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s03-00.png|The
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s03-01.png|nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s03-02.png|to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s03-03.png|which increases the range of things that can be
data/segments/e02/e02-086/e02-086-s03-04.png|made enormously .
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s00-00.png|As a still further development , we follow
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s00-01.png|with a good basic kit , which includes
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s00-02.png|the fuller kit ( which in its turn , of course ,
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s00-03.png|includes the bare minimum kit ) .
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s01-00.png|With this the vast majority of jobs
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s01-01.png|can be done , though for advanced
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s01-02.png|cabinet work the necessity for
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s01-03.png|certain special tools will become
data/segments/e02/e02-091/e02-091-s01-04.png|obvious .
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s00-00.png|Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s00-01.png|machines , the choice of which will
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s00-02.png|depend partly upon the space available
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s00-03.png|in the workshop , the amount one
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s00-04.png|is prepared to pay , and the type of
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s00-05.png|work a man normally does .
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s01-00.png|First ,
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s01-01.png|however , a word of advice generally .
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s02-00.png|Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s02-01.png|machines .
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s03-00.png|They never are cheap in the
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s03-01.png|long run .
data/segments/e02/e02-094/e02-094-s04-00.png|They may be inaccurate ,
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s00-00.png|Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s00-01.png|in design or quality soon become apparent .
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s01-00.png|It is far
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s01-01.png|better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s01-02.png|quality , and not handicap yourself from the start .
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s02-00.png|To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s02-01.png|yourself to blame the tools when the job does
data/segments/e02/e02-100/e02-100-s02-02.png|not turn out quite right !
data/segments/e02/e02-117/e02-117-s00-00.png|Many men with only limited accommodation
data/segments/e02/e02-117/e02-117-s00-01.png|have to do their woodwork on the kitchen table .
data/segments/e02/e02-117/e02-117-s01-00.png|Providing this is sound , some perfectly good
data/segments/e02/e02-117/e02-117-s01-01.png|work can be done on it , but the usual problems
data/segments/e02/e02-117/e02-117-s01-02.png|are those of the vice , the bench stop , and storage

data/segments/e04/e04-000/e04-000-s02-03.png|taking a good finish .
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s00-00.png|Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s00-01.png|timber as shown in Fig. 1 .
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s01-00.png|Although the timber will have already
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s01-01.png|been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s01-02.png|a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s01-03.png|will show up after painting .
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s02-00.png|The dimensions given enable the
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s02-01.png|feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height
data/segments/e04/e04-004/e04-004-s02-02.png|can be altered if required .
data/segments/e04/e04-008/e04-008-s00-00.png|All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,
data/segments/e04/e04-008/e04-008-s00-01.png|which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat

data/segments/e04/e04-008/e04-008-s01-00.png|The side frames are joined by four cross pieces

data/segments/e04/e04-022/e04-022-s01-00.png|These can then be cut at the correct
data/segments/e04/e04-022/e04-022-s01-01.png|angle and B is glued and nailed in place .
data/segments/e04/e04-022/e04-022-s02-00.png|A piece of hardboard is then cut and pinned

data/segments/e04/e04-030/e04-030-s02-00.png|Make sure that these
data/segments/e04/e04-030/e04-030-s02-01.png|are well secured as they will have to withstand
data/segments/e04/e04-030/e04-030-s02-02.png|considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s00-00.png|Punch in all nail and panel pin heads and fill the holes

data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s01-00.png|Then thoroughly glasspaper the whole
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s01-01.png|framework and round off any sharp edges ( such as the
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s01-02.png|edge of the seat , feeding tray , etc ) .
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s02-00.png|Fill the grain with a
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s02-01.png|woodfiller in the usual way and paint the frame in
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s02-02.png|a suitable pastel shade , using a contrasting colour
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s02-03.png|for the seat and the back which can be decorated with
data/segments/e04/e04-034/e04-034-s02-04.png|a suitable nursery transfer .
data/segments/e04/e04-038/e04-038-s00-00.png|Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous

data/segments/e04/e04-038/e04-038-s01-00.png|Finally , it is as well
data/segments/e04/e04-038/e04-038-s01-01.png|to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
data/segments/e04/e04-038/e04-038-s01-02.png|material that might be available as otherwise the
data/segments/e04/e04-038/e04-038-s01-03.png|paint would soon be scratched off .

data/segments/e04/e04-052/e04-052-s00-00.png|For instance , in Canada we use galvanised nails
data/segments/e04/e04-052/e04-052-s00-01.png|in place of screws .
data/segments/e04/e04-052/e04-052-s01-00.png|We just bend them over and clamp

data/segments/e04/e04-058/e04-058-s02-02.png|Columbia .
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s00-00.png|This is hot pressed and resin bonded to ensure
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s00-01.png|a permanently water proof glue line .
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s01-00.png|Be sure to
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s01-01.png|see that the edge bears the mark , P.M.B.C. Exterior .
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s02-00.png|This may be bought at any good timber merchants .
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s03-00.png|The transoms can be made of any sound five-ply
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s03-01.png|wood of the same make , or oak or mahogany .
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s04-00.png|For the
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s04-01.png|last one I made , I used the two flaps from an old
data/segments/e04/e04-062/e04-062-s04-02.png|mahogany table which I bought at a sale for one

data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s00-00.png|I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s00-01.png|rowing this dinghy ( Fig. 3 ) .
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s01-00.png|They are very simple , cheap
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s01-01.png|and easy to make .
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s02-00.png|As will be seen from the plan
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s02-01.png|there is only a single gunwale on the outside .
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s03-00.png|I find that the type of rowlock we use in Canada
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s03-01.png|is difficult to obtain here and expensive .
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s04-00.png|I overcome
data/segments/e04/e04-068/e04-068-s04-01.png|this in another way as shown in Fig. 4 .
data/segments/e04/e04-079/e04-079-s00-00.png|Cut the moulds and the

data/segments/e04/e04-083/e04-083-s00-00.png|The edges of the transoms should be bevelled to

data/segments/e04/e04-083/e04-083-s01-00.png|Don't forget to cut out on each side of each mould
data/segments/e04/e04-083/e04-083-s01-01.png|to allow for the chines to rest in these

data/segments/e04/e04-083/e04-083-s01-03.png|moulds , which will only be used whilst
data/segments/e04/e04-083/e04-083-s01-04.png|the hull is under construction .
data/segments/e04/e04-086/e04-086-s00-00.png|The chine is the long stringer on each side which

data/segments/e04/e04-086/e04-086-s03-01.png|in the plan , the transoms have a frame 1 in. by 1 in.
data/segments/e04/e04-086/e04-086-s03-02.png|on each side .
data/segments/e04/e04-091/e04-091-s00-00.png|The chines are morticed into this and butt up

data/segments/e04/e04-091/e04-091-s02-00.png|Glue , screw and make fast .
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s00-00.png|The skeleton of the boat will now take shape ,
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s00-01.png|and this is the time to check before making fast
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s00-02.png|to see that nothing is distorted .
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s01-00.png|Ensure that
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s01-01.png|the outside measurements from transom to transom
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s01-02.png|are equal on each side and that the transoms
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s01-03.png|are parallel horizontally .
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s02-00.png|Next bevel the chines
data/segments/e04/e04-095/e04-095-s02-01.png|with a plane so that the bottom will fit snugly .
data/segments/e04/e04-099/e04-099-s00-00.png|Cut out the bottom and sides accurately from the

data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s00-00.png|Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready
data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s00-01.png|to plank the sides .
data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s01-00.png|Start again at the bows ,
data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s01-01.png|clamping into position with a ' D ' clamp .
data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s02-00.png|Bend
data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s02-01.png|round the frame to the stern and clamp there .

data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s04-00.png|After generously covering with glue , screw
data/segments/e04/e04-103/e04-103-s04-01.png|the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s00-00.png|Use 5/8 by No. 4 gauge screws ( brass ) or nail
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s00-01.png|with inch and a quarter galvanized nails , if

data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s01-00.png|Use flat head screws
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s01-01.png|about 4 in. apart and do not counter-sink in
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s01-02.png|the 1/4 in. ply .
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s02-00.png|Make a very small hole for
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s02-01.png|the screw to allow for a good grip .
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s03-00.png|Remember
data/segments/e04/e04-109/e04-109-s03-01.png|to glue before screwing .

data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s00-01.png|which is cut in one piece .
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s01-00.png|It should overlap just a
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s01-01.png|trifle ; this can be cleaned up later .
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s02-00.png|As you are
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s02-01.png|screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s02-02.png|necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with

data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s03-00.png|I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s03-01.png|the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and
data/segments/e04/e04-114/e04-114-s03-02.png|the bottom shaped transom facing .
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s00-00.png|Again , don't forget to glue .
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s01-00.png|Now put on the keel and
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s01-01.png|the rubbing strakes and you are ready to lift the boat off
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s01-02.png|the moulds .
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s02-00.png|You won't want them again for this boat , so
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s02-01.png|shift them right out of the way .
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s03-00.png|Place the boat right side
data/segments/e04/e04-119/e04-119-s03-01.png|up on two boxes or trestles of convenient height for

data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s00-00.png|Fix on the gunwales and insert the thwarts ( seats )
data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s00-01.png|taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats

data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s01-00.png|Make the
data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s01-01.png|four blocks for the rowlocks and mark their positions
data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s01-02.png|before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s01-03.png|a rivet where you will have to cut out the inside ( gunwale )
data/segments/e04/e04-124/e04-124-s01-04.png|one to fit the block .
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s00-00.png|I rivet my gunwales together through the side of the hull
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s00-01.png|with copper nails and roves .
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s01-00.png|It greatly improves the
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s01-01.png|appearance and the strength .
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s02-00.png|Paint with good marine primer ,
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s02-01.png|undercoat and at least one coat of finishing paint .
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s03-00.png|WHEN an assortment of differently coloured materials are cut
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s03-01.png|into a variety of shapes they can be combined by either
data/segments/e04/e04-127/e04-127-s03-02.png|making fabric pictures or designs .
data/segments/e04/e04-132/e04-132-s00-00.png|While these may ultimately be made into a picture
data/segments/e04/e04-132/e04-132-s00-01.png|for framing and hanging on a wall , they may
data/segments/e04/e04-132/e04-132-s00-02.png|also be arranged into a design , and the

data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s00-00.png|This could hardly happen without the
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s00-01.png|herring having some orientation with the
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s00-02.png|sea bottom .
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s01-00.png|It means that the crowding
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s01-01.png|is caused during the daytime , and that
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s01-02.png|the herring must continue to migrate over
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s01-03.png|the ground as well as in midwater and
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s01-04.png|during the swim ( the swim at East Anglia
data/segments/e06/e06-000/e06-000-s01-05.png|is always from the north ) .
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s00-00.png|Thus we can see that herring
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s00-01.png|movements , although primarily
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s00-02.png|instinctive perhaps , and certainly
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s00-03.png|helped and hindered by water flow ,
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s00-04.png|are also closely related to the sea-bed
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s00-05.png|geography .
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s01-00.png|Geography , too , names the
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s01-01.png|great fisheries that depend on them :
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s01-02.png|the Fladen Ground ( where again most big
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s01-03.png|shots are taken on the edges ) , the Gut ,
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s01-04.png|a deep-water channel to the Dogger where
data/segments/e06/e06-003/e06-003-s01-05.png|the herring spawn along the northern
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s00-00.png|The effect of bottom congestion due to
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s00-01.png|the light pressure is inevitably mixed
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s00-02.png|with that of the suitability of ground
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s00-03.png|for spawning .
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s01-00.png|Both result in crowding ,
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s01-01.png|so there is no need to try to separate
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s01-02.png|them - thank Heaven !
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s02-00.png|A good picture of
data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s02-01.png|this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning

data/segments/e06/e06-006/e06-006-s02-03.png|to the Klondykes and the Reef along

data/segments/e06/e06-010/e06-010-s00-00.png|In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
data/segments/e06/e06-010/e06-010-s01-00.png|Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure .
data/segments/e06/e06-010/e06-010-s02-00.png|But
data/segments/e06/e06-010/e06-010-s02-01.png|they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until

data/segments/e06/e06-010/e06-010-s03-00.png|Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
data/segments/e06/e06-010/e06-010-s03-01.png|their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable

data/segments/e06/e06-015/e06-015-s03-01.png|shoals that gather at the Knoll or
data/segments/e06/e06-015/e06-015-s03-02.png|other banks are most of them
data/segments/e06/e06-015/e06-015-s03-03.png|going to travel a hundred
data/segments/e06/e06-015/e06-015-s03-04.png|miles farther south before they
data/segments/e06/e06-015/e06-015-s03-05.png|spawn .
data/segments/e06/e06-015/e06-015-s04-00.png|Some will spawn at the
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s00-00.png|So the arrival of any particular shoal
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s00-01.png|fish at a certain spawning ground may
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s00-02.png|be accidental .
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s01-00.png|Yet there will always be some
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s01-01.png|that find it if enough are travelling , just as
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s01-02.png|the robin who gets back exactly may be
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s01-03.png|only one among thousands who do not .
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s02-00.png|But this southerly migration is not
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s02-01.png|accidental .
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s03-00.png|Being contranatant or against
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s03-01.png|the drift , it probably has a survival value
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s03-02.png|in ensuring that the fry after hatching
data/segments/e06/e06-021/e06-021-s03-03.png|are drifted back into the normal home
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s00-00.png|Drift in another form probably
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s00-01.png|explains how these migrating herring
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s00-02.png|are biased to east or west by the
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s00-03.png|different winds .
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s01-00.png|Strong westerlies
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s01-01.png|are well known to bring good
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s01-02.png|longshore fishings .
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s02-00.png|The surface
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s02-01.png|water that is blown offshore must
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s02-02.png|be replaced by an underflow bringing
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s02-03.png|with it the herring to the Norfolk
data/segments/e06/e06-026/e06-026-s02-04.png|and Suffolk beaches .
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s00-00.png|Easterly winds , on the other hand ,
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s00-01.png|mean no herring along the shore , as
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s00-02.png|recent years have shown .
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-00.png|A succession
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-01.png|of winds is needed for this effect of
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-02.png|course - one breeze will not do it ,
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-03.png|though a very hard westerly will
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-04.png|often start off the " local " herring ;
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-05.png|but quite apart from this wind effect
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-06.png|there is an easterly drift special
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-07.png|to this rump of coastline , caused by
data/segments/e06/e06-030/e06-030-s01-08.png|the meeting of water from north and south .
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s00-00.png|Herring fishermen call this " the outset " .
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s01-00.png|It
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s01-01.png|is strongest at spring tides , when without
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s01-02.png|wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east-
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s01-03.png|ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s01-04.png|almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s01-05.png|Knoll .
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s02-00.png|Without an explanation of how it
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s02-01.png|works , it may well be that this outset , akin
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s02-02.png|to the mouth of a great salmon river , has
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s02-03.png|been the biggest factor through the ages
data/segments/e06/e06-033/e06-033-s02-04.png|in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s00-00.png|The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 )
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s00-01.png|has always differed from that of the
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s00-02.png|summer fisheries .
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s01-00.png|There is the " swim "
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s01-01.png|at slack waters , even in daylight
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s01-02.png|sometimes ; and the high swimming ,
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s01-03.png|when fish are caught only in the top
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s01-04.png|few yards of netting .
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s02-00.png|These and other
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s02-01.png|fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s02-02.png|to this fishery , which unfortunately seems
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s02-03.png|to be dying out ; but a full discussion of
data/segments/e06/e06-037/e06-037-s02-04.png|them is beyond the present scope .
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s00-00.png|The Bow-wave Theory .
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s01-00.png|This assumes
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s01-01.png|that all fishing gear , when moving ,
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s01-02.png|sends before it a kind of scaring effect ,
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s01-03.png|probably through waves or vibrations in
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s01-04.png|the water or along the ground .
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s02-00.png|Underwater films suggest that the
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s02-01.png|footrope of a trawl does this .
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s03-00.png|Films
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s03-01.png|have also shown plaice moving before
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s03-02.png|a seine net in just the same way after
data/segments/e06/e06-041/e06-041-s03-03.png|being gathered inwards by the ropes .
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s00-00.png|( Just how the seine ropes do this is not yet proved ; it may
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s00-01.png|be by actual contact , or by sight reaction to the disturbed
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s00-02.png|sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s00-03.png|through or along the bottom . )
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s01-00.png|But given such a bow
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s01-01.png|wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something
data/segments/e06/e06-046/e06-046-s01-02.png|to overcome its effect , very few fish would be caught .
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s00-00.png|Let us consider first what would
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s00-01.png|appear to be the simplest case -
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s00-02.png|that of flat fish on the bottom .
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s01-00.png|The evidence suggest that the fish are
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s01-01.png|aware of the moving footrope before
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s01-02.png|it reaches them .
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s02-00.png|They move away before
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s02-01.png|it , swimming at the same speed
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s02-02.png|for an unknown period of time , until
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s02-03.png|they become ( 1 ) tired , or ( 2 ) more used
data/segments/e06/e06-049/e06-049-s02-04.png|to the disturbance .
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s00-00.png|Then they stop swimming and are caught .
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s01-00.png|In
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s01-01.png|the seine-net film this usually seemed to
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s01-02.png|happen just after the fish had risen above
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s01-03.png|the footrope , and presumably out of its
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s01-04.png|field of disturbance , or bow wave .
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s02-00.png|This suggests
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s02-01.png|that the wave might be transmitted by the
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s02-02.png|sea-bed , though the footrope in this case
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s02-03.png|was actually just off the bottom and was
data/segments/e06/e06-053/e06-053-s02-04.png|indeed passing over some fish .
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s00-00.png|Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s01-00.png|And in this film the rise of the fish was
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s01-01.png|small , a matter of a foot or two .
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s02-00.png|With round
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s02-01.png|fish like haddock , which would hardly
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s02-02.png|find safety on the bottom , this cover
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s02-03.png|would seem to be even more essential ;
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s02-04.png|but more films are needed to prove this .
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s03-00.png|Cover in the fast-moving trawl is considered
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s03-01.png|essential to catch round fish whose
data/segments/e06/e06-070/e06-070-s03-02.png|reaction to disturbance would be upwards .

data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s01-01.png|in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s01-02.png|have made headway , and although
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s01-03.png|numerous small clay pots are used each
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s01-04.png|year , they are fewer than they were 10
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s01-05.png|years ago .
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s02-00.png|In the larger sizes there is still
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s02-01.png|no real substitute for clay that can be
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s02-02.png|obtained at a comparable price , except the
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s02-03.png|bituminized paper pots which are used on
data/segments/e07/e07-072/e07-072-s02-04.png|commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s00-00.png|The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s00-01.png|brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s00-02.png|handling , the annual losses are often around
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s00-03.png|10 per cent. , and where the handling and
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s00-04.png|storage facilities are not too good , these
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s00-05.png|losses will be even greater .
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s01-00.png|This does not
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s01-01.png|necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s01-02.png|they are not quite so fragile as the
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s01-03.png|smaller ones and are not normally thrown
data/segments/e07/e07-076/e07-076-s01-04.png|about in quite the same way .
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s00-00.png|The storage problem puts clay pots at a
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s00-01.png|definite disadvantage .
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s01-00.png|They are fairly heavy
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s01-01.png|and difficult things to accommodate and
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s01-02.png|they must have some protection from severe
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s01-03.png|weather , which can be quite a headache in
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s01-04.png|a small garden .
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s02-00.png|While admitting that
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s02-01.png|broken pots have on occasions provided
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s02-02.png|artists with delightful studies , there is no
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s02-03.png|doubt that a pile of badly stacked ,
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s02-04.png|half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
data/segments/e07/e07-079/e07-079-s02-05.png|from any point of view .
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-00.png|Every garden boy will agree that having to
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-01.png|wash clay pots is a definite factor in
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-02.png|favour of their abolition ; in fact one
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-03.png|young man was so wholehearted about this
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-04.png|a few years ago that he made the headlines
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-05.png|for having smashed a large number # to
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s00-06.png|relieve his feelings .
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s01-00.png|On the small-to-medium
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s01-01.png|establishment , it is a disagreeable chore
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s01-02.png|which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s01-03.png|whereas on larger establishments the pots
data/segments/e07/e07-083/e07-083-s01-04.png|can be sterilized or washed by machine .
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s00-00.png|It is not easy to make an economic
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s00-01.png|comparison between clay pots and the various
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s00-02.png|substitutes ; the former may last indefinitely
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s00-03.png|with luck , while the latter are often
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s00-04.png|expendable used only once .
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s01-00.png|Clay pots are
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s01-01.png|efficient and congenial containers in which

data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s02-00.png|In their proper setting they
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s02-01.png|are not unattractive and , in spite of
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s02-02.png|their shortcomings , most gardeners have
data/segments/e07/e07-086/e07-086-s02-03.png|a nostalgic affection for them .
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s00-00.png|Present-day pots are better finished , do
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s00-01.png|not get dirty so readily and are easier to
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s00-02.png|wash .
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s01-00.png|The deep rims make for neater and
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s01-01.png|safer stacking , though they are still
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s01-02.png|expensive and still get broken .
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s02-00.png|On the
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s02-01.png|other hand , there is really no replacement
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s02-02.png|for the larger sizes , so they have the
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s02-03.png|decided advantage of being the only
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s02-04.png|suitable container available in quantity
data/segments/e07/e07-090/e07-090-s02-05.png|for fairly large plants .
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s00-00.png|Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s00-01.png|pots for plant raising .
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s01-00.png|These are compressed blocks of
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s01-01.png|compost , made in a specially devised press to
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s01-02.png|simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s02-00.png|Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s02-01.png|are made of the same compost as would have
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s02-02.png|been used in a pot , the # only difference being
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s02-03.png|that it is used in a slightly moister
data/segments/e07/e07-094/e07-094-s02-04.png|condition .
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s00-00.png|Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s00-01.png|in the normal way , the only real difference
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s00-02.png|being that more of the watering is done through a
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s00-03.png|rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s00-04.png|of water .
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s01-00.png|First-class plants of tomatoes ,
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s01-01.png|cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s01-02.png|celery and onions , may all be raised in soil
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s01-03.png|blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s01-04.png|dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,
data/segments/e07/e07-098/e07-098-s01-05.png|lupins and numerous others .
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s00-00.png|One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s00-01.png|one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s00-02.png|completely .
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s01-00.png|Manufacturing the block and planting
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s01-01.png|it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s01-02.png|and a superior plant , which transplants more
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s01-03.png|easily , is produced .
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s02-00.png|The obvious limitation #
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s02-01.png|is that soil blocks can only be used for
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s02-02.png|propagating ; there can be no progression to a
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s02-03.png|larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s02-04.png|to be moved ; it must be planted out or
data/segments/e07/e07-101/e07-101-s02-05.png|potted .
data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s00-00.png|Many amateur gardeners might improve their
data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s00-01.png|results by buying a small hand-operated soil

data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s00-03.png|buying small pots to improve their composts .
data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s01-00.png|The various types of small paper pots are very
data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s01-01.png|useful for short-term operations , but are
data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s01-02.png|inclined to collapse if the plants are in them
data/segments/e07/e07-105/e07-105-s01-03.png|too long .
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s00-00.png|They are # quite useful for plants that are

data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s00-02.png|their cheapness making them attractive to the
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s00-03.png|nurseryman ; there is also considerable saving
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s00-04.png|in carriage costs because of their lightness .
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s01-00.png|There are many types of plastic pots available ;
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s01-01.png|some expensive , some quite cheap ; some good
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s01-02.png|and others not so good .
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s02-00.png|A wide range of
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s02-01.png|plants grow quite well in plastic pots and
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s02-02.png|usually need less water than those in clay
data/segments/e07/e07-108/e07-108-s02-03.png|pots .
data/segments/e07/e07-112/e07-112-s00-00.png|They are slightly more difficult to
data/segments/e07/e07-112/e07-112-s00-01.png|manage , however , until a little experience
data/segments/e07/e07-112/e07-112-s00-02.png|has been gained with them .
data/segments/e07/e07-112/e07-112-s01-00.png|Plastic pots
data/segments/e07/e07-112/e07-112-s01-01.png|are usually more expensive than clay ones ,

data/segments/e07/e07-112/e07-112-s01-03.png|will last a long time with normal care .
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s00-00.png|The job of the teacher is to set the learner's
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s00-01.png|vocabulary to work on the existing store
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s00-02.png|so as to make it grow .

data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s02-00.png|The solitary learner has to find out
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s02-01.png|how to do this for himself , with the help
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s02-02.png|of books .
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s03-00.png|He uses his vocabulary to
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s03-01.png|ask questions and uses the books to
data/segments/f01/f01-053/f01-053-s03-02.png|find the answers .
data/segments/f01/f01-058/f01-058-s00-00.png|Thus learning how to learn means becoming

data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s00-00.png|And then you get a knock on the head and all evidence of
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s00-01.png|" mind " vanishes , at any rate for some time .
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s01-00.png|It seems very difficult
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s01-01.png|to detach the mind from the brain , and all the biological ,
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s01-02.png|surgical and pharmacological evidence points to a very
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s01-03.png|close connection .
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s02-00.png|There is a lot to be said for keeping the
data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s02-01.png|word " soul " to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable

data/segments/f01/f01-066/f01-066-s02-05.png|are clearly associated with the brain .
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s00-00.png|Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s00-01.png|picture of this " basis " of mental phenomena ?
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s01-00.png|The physicists have succeeded remarkably well ,
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s01-01.png|with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed

data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s01-03.png|as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s01-04.png|gases and so on .
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s02-00.png|Where has psychology got to in its
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s02-01.png|theories of " mind " ?
data/segments/f01/f01-070/f01-070-s03-00.png|Are there any ultimate units

data/segments/f01/f01-075/f01-075-s00-00.png|At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
data/segments/f01/f01-075/f01-075-s00-01.png|be analysed into discrete bits .
data/segments/f01/f01-075/f01-075-s01-00.png|These bits were
data/segments/f01/f01-075/f01-075-s01-01.png|identified as elementary sensations .

data/segments/f01/f01-075/f01-075-s03-00.png|But this view led to too many difficulties and

data/segments/f01/f01-075/f01-075-s04-03.png|discover ultimate units .
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s00-00.png|We must beware , however , of supposing that there must be any
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s00-01.png|close analogy between the units of quite different
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s00-02.png|sciences .
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s01-00.png|For example the success of the atomic theory
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s01-01.png|in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s01-02.png|units of geometry must be points .
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s02-00.png|It would be more
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s02-01.png|correct to regard operations as the ultimate units of
data/segments/f01/f01-081/f01-081-s02-02.png|geometry .
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s00-00.png|There have been many conflicting tendencies in
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s00-01.png|psychology in its search for ultimate units and here
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s00-02.png|we can only indicate what seems to be the most promising
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s00-03.png|concept which is current today .
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s01-00.png|It is known as the schema .
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s02-00.png|It is not an easy concept and if I try to make it
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s02-01.png|concrete it will be at the cost of over-simplification
data/segments/f01/f01-085/f01-085-s02-02.png|but even so it may be better than a meaningless abstraction .
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s00-00.png|It is the tendency to get things
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s00-01.png|the wrong way round .
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s01-00.png|As a
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s01-01.png|psychologist I am constantly
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s01-02.png|encountering this tendency
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s01-03.png|in friends and acquaintances .
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s02-00.png|They think there is something
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s02-01.png|inevitably " queer " about psychology
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s02-02.png|and this feeling of queerness
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s02-03.png|usually boils down to a quite
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s02-04.png|mistaken belief that the
data/segments/f01/f01-135/f01-135-s02-05.png|psychologist first looks into ...
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s00-00.png|This is what I mean by " getting things the wrong way
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s00-01.png|round " .
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s01-00.png|He is far more likely to find out about how
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s01-01.png|his own mind works by looking at other people's .
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s02-00.png|For although looking inwards ( or " introspecting "
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s02-01.png|as it is called ) , is not entirely ruled out ,
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s02-02.png|nowadays most psychologists would agree that it is
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s02-03.png|one of the most unreliable methods of getting
data/segments/f01/f01-139/f01-139-s02-04.png|any precise information .
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s00-00.png|And so they prefer objective methods .
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s01-00.png|Since they cannot
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s01-01.png|directly look into the mental processes of another
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s01-02.png|person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s01-03.png|to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s01-04.png|this behaviour .
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s02-00.png|This is no more queer than the method
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s02-01.png|of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,
data/segments/f01/f01-143/f01-143-s02-02.png|and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s00-00.png|He may never have had the disease himself but he
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s00-01.png|can nevertheless identify it .
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s01-00.png|Similarly the psychologist has
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s01-01.png|to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s01-02.png|all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s01-03.png|correspond with anything in his own experience .
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s02-00.png|We know
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s02-01.png|very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s02-02.png|provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s02-03.png|psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
data/segments/f01/f01-147/f01-147-s02-04.png|the neuro-physiologists .

data/segments/f02/f02-003/f02-003-s01-01.png|the panel decided to seek further insight into the

data/segments/f02/f02-044/f02-044-s00-02.png|to let older employees attend day-release courses on preparation
data/segments/f02/f02-044/f02-044-s00-03.png|for retirement , their wages paid for the time thus spent .

data/segments/f02/f02-044/f02-044-s02-02.png|to the men and their employers that the venture was an
data/segments/f02/f02-044/f02-044-s02-03.png|experiment from which the organisers hoped to learn as much
data/segments/f02/f02-044/f02-044-s02-04.png|as the participants .
data/segments/f02/f02-076/f02-076-s00-00.png|1 . Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
data/segments/f02/f02-076/f02-076-s00-01.png|and retirement according to the occupational
data/segments/f02/f02-076/f02-076-s00-02.png|level of employees ?
data/segments/f02/f02-076/f02-076-s01-00.png|2 . If so , which occupational

data/segments/f03/f03-174/f03-174-s06-00.png|I 'm afraid
data/segments/f03/f03-174/f03-174-s06-01.png|I have not had much experience of public speaking .
data/segments/f03/f03-182/f03-182-s00-00.png|But that 's a terrible way to begin !

data/segments/f03/f03-182/f03-182-s07-00.png|And they say , too ,
data/segments/f03/f03-182/f03-182-s07-01.png|that television makes its appeal to those of lesser

data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s00-00.png|May I suggest that you have proved that
data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s00-01.png|right !

data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s05-01.png|candidate often used that finish .
data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s06-00.png|No wonder he
data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s06-01.png|didn't get in !
data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s07-00.png|Instead he might have ended
data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s07-01.png|this way :
data/segments/f03/f03-191/f03-191-s08-00.png|Well , those are my views .
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s00-00.png|When he learned what was causing the commotion he
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s00-01.png|became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s00-02.png|taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s00-03.png|grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s00-04.png|Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s00-05.png|been his bride .
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s01-00.png|There was little doubt of how
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s01-01.png|she had met her death , and even less that it
data/segments/f04/f04-004/f04-004-s01-02.png|had been murder .
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s00-00.png|She had been struck several times with a blunt
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s00-01.png|instrument , and her head was smashed in .
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s01-00.png|There were signs of a violent struggle , blood
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s01-01.png|on the cushions and floor , and the remains
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s01-02.png|of her broken umbrella .
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s02-00.png|But a pair of bone
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s02-01.png|cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
data/segments/f04/f04-007/f04-007-s02-02.png|to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s00-00.png|The body was examined , and it was definitely
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s00-01.png|established that no sexual assault had taken place .
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s01-00.png|It seemed probable that the motive had been
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s01-01.png|robbery , and this was further confirmed when a
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s01-02.png|check was made with the woman's relations in
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s01-03.png|Hounslow .
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s02-00.png|Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s02-01.png|Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth .
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s03-00.png|Her day
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s03-01.png|off was Thursday , and before coming up to London
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s03-02.png|in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s03-03.png|one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
data/segments/f04/f04-011/f04-011-s03-04.png|other at Hounslow , where she kept a shop .
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s00-00.png|Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s00-01.png|and arrived at Hounslow around 5 P.M. , where
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s00-02.png|she had tea with her other sister , and then
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s00-03.png|went to catch the 7.42 .
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s01-00.png|Her sister saw her
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s01-01.png|to the station , helping her with some of
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s01-02.png|her packages .
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s02-00.png|This sister was able to establish
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s02-01.png|that she had carried a green purse and
data/segments/f04/f04-016/f04-016-s02-02.png|had bought a railway ticket .
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s00-00.png|But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s00-01.png|was found at Waterloo .
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s01-00.png|Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s01-01.png|likely that she had been carrying much money .
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s02-00.png|A porter at Hounslow
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s02-01.png|supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s02-02.png|compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it
data/segments/f04/f04-020/f04-020-s02-03.png|had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s00-00.png|The police began a systematic search of the line -
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s00-01.png|no easy task , but one in which patience and method
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s00-02.png|paid off .
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s01-00.png|At a spot on the embankment between
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s01-01.png|Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s01-02.png|pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s01-03.png|sticking to it .
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s02-00.png|The murder weapon , more than likely ,
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s02-01.png|and perhaps evidence enough to have brought a
data/segments/f04/f04-024/f04-024-s02-02.png|killer to book in modern times .
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s00-00.png|But in 1897 , alas ! there was no fingerprint bureau ,
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s00-01.png|no experts to check and photograph any ' dabs ' it
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s00-02.png|might have yielded .
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s01-00.png|It was a tough case to
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s01-01.png|tackle , and Superintendent Robinson , of the L.S.W.R.
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s01-02.png|Police , and Chief Inspector Marshall , of Scotland
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s01-03.png|Yard , combined forces in the investigation .
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s02-00.png|While
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s02-01.png|accepting the likelihood that Miss Camp had been
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s02-02.png|attacked for the sake of robbery , they did not
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s02-03.png|overlook the possibility that this might have
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s02-04.png|disguised another motive , and a thorough check
data/segments/f04/f04-028/f04-028-s02-05.png|of her former men friends and acquaintances began .
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s00-00.png|They also had to cope with the usual flood of rumours , so-
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s00-01.png|me well meant , some mischievous , including one that a
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s00-02.png|man had been seen fleeing from Vauxhall station on
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s00-03.png|the Thursday evening , with blood actually dripping from
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s00-04.png|his hands .
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s01-00.png|The inquest was opened on February 17 , but ,
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s01-01.png|beyond the jury hearing a formal identification of
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s01-02.png|the victim and inspecting at Waterloo the carriage
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s01-03.png|in which she had died , there was nothing on
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s01-04.png|which to proceed , and the inquest was
data/segments/f04/f04-032/f04-032-s01-05.png|adjourned .
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s00-00.png|Day by day the police followed up likely and even unlikely
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s00-01.png|trails .
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s01-00.png|It was learned that Elizabeth Camp had been lending
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s01-01.png|money to her relatives , and her brother-in-law was asked for
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s01-02.png|a detailed account of his movements on the 11th .
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s02-00.png|The dead
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s02-01.png|woman had been engaged once before - to a barman
data/segments/f04/f04-035/f04-035-s02-02.png|named Brown .
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s00-00.png|This man agreed that his engagement had
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s00-01.png|been broken off after one particular
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s00-02.png|tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s00-03.png|money .
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s01-00.png|All the while the police were casting about
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s01-01.png|for a man who had been seen leaving the train
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s01-02.png|at Wandsworth .
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s02-00.png|A passenger described this individual
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s02-01.png|as a man of about thirty , of medium height , with
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s02-02.png|a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
data/segments/f04/f04-039/f04-039-s02-03.png|and a top-hat .
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s00-00.png|The porter at the station bore out this
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s00-01.png|description , but the man was not traced .
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s01-00.png|Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s01-01.png|for a man did obligingly present himself
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s01-02.png|at Wandsworth police-station , claiming to have
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s01-03.png|committed the murder - but he was mentally
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s01-04.png|defective , and , despite his claim to infamy ,
data/segments/f04/f04-043/f04-043-s01-05.png|had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s00-00.png|Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s00-01.png|had at first been considered as belonging to the killer ,
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s00-02.png|proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s00-03.png|they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s00-04.png|of her sisters .
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s01-00.png|A young man from Reading named Marshall
data/segments/f04/f04-046/f04-046-s01-01.png|had an uncomfortable time in the presence of the coroner .
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s00-00.png|This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s00-01.png|to have been away for four days .
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s01-00.png|Not in itself a crime , but , added to
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s01-01.png|the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s01-02.png|dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s01-03.png|explain .
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s02-00.png|His story was that he had left home to try to
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s02-01.png|join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
data/segments/f04/f04-049/f04-049-s02-02.png|his military bearing ) , and this was accepted .
data/segments/f04/f04-053/f04-053-s00-00.png|And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with
data/segments/f04/f04-053/f04-053-s00-01.png|adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return
data/segments/f04/f04-053/f04-053-s00-02.png|a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or
data/segments/f04/f04-053/f04-053-s00-03.png|persons unknown . "

data/segments/f04/f04-061/f04-061-s01-05.png|proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s00-00.png|The mere thought of subterranean travel
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s00-01.png|gave others a feeling of danger .
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s01-00.png|A medical journal
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s01-01.png|said , " the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s01-02.png|immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s01-03.png|sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s01-04.png|momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s01-05.png|of annihilation . "
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s02-00.png|It was also prophesied that
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s02-01.png|passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
data/segments/f04/f04-064/f04-064-s02-02.png|darkness .
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s00-00.png|For all that , as far as England is concerned ,
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s00-01.png|there have been only two occasions on
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s00-02.png|which a body has been found in a tunnel
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s00-03.png|in circumstances pointing to murder .
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s01-00.png|The first was that of Mr Gold , in the famous
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s01-01.png|Lefroy case , and by an odd chance the second tragedy
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s01-02.png|occurred on the same line , although this time the
data/segments/f04/f04-068/f04-068-s01-03.png|victim was a woman .
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s00-00.png|Though in the minds of most people there was
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s00-01.png|no doubt that the woman had been the victim
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s00-02.png|of foul play , the verdict brought in was that there
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s00-03.png|was not sufficient evidence to show whether
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s00-04.png|she had fallen or been thrown from a train .
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s01-00.png|The Merstham Tunnel , on the London-to-
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s01-01.png|Brighton line , is approximately one mile long ,
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s01-02.png|and some time before midnight on September
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s01-03.png|24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of
data/segments/f04/f04-071/f04-071-s01-04.png|the London , Brighton and South Coast Railway ,
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s00-00.png|It was the battered and broken body of a woman .
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s01-00.png|He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s01-01.png|Station , and a stretcher party took the body to
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s01-02.png|the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s02-00.png|Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s02-01.png|had walked deliberately into the blackness and
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s02-02.png|into the path of some train ?
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s03-00.png|This hardly seemed
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s03-01.png|likely , since , when she was examined by a local
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s03-02.png|doctor , the woman , young , small , and rather plump ,
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s03-03.png|was found to have her own silk scarf drawn
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s03-04.png|almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends
data/segments/f04/f04-074/f04-074-s03-05.png|thrust in her mouth like a gag .
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s00-00.png|Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s00-01.png|and there were other injuries on her body which had
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s00-02.png|occurred before her death was ensured by some
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s00-03.png|train which had roared through the tunnel .
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s01-00.png|There were
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s01-01.png|no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s01-02.png|fication , no money , and no railway ticket .
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s02-00.png|By then
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s02-01.png|reports were being gathered about all traffic over
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s02-02.png|this stretch of line , but no information was
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s02-03.png|forthcoming about any carriage with an open
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s02-04.png|door , nor any passenger reporting an incident
data/segments/f04/f04-079/f04-079-s02-05.png|which might relate .
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s00-00.png|So the body of this small girl with the blue eyes and
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s00-01.png|long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s00-02.png|remained a mystery until later the following day .
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s01-00.png|During that time a description of the girl was
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s01-01.png|circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s01-02.png|identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two .
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s02-00.png|The girl , who was described as being " always bright and
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s02-01.png|jolly , " had been unmarried , and lived at Lavender Hill ,
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s02-02.png|Clapham , on the premises of a dairyman , Bridger , for
data/segments/f04/f04-083/f04-083-s02-03.png|whom she worked as a book-keeper .
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s00-00.png|On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s00-01.png|evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s00-02.png|Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s00-03.png|gone for long .
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s01-00.png|According to Miss Hone , she had not been
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s01-01.png|carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small
data/segments/f04/f04-087/f04-087-s01-02.png|purse .
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s00-00.png|At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s00-01.png|was able to identify a photograph of the
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s00-02.png|girl , and he said he had last seen her
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s00-03.png|on platform six waiting to board
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s00-04.png|a train for the short run to Victoria .
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s01-00.png|A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s01-01.png|a young lady " as near as possible "
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s01-02.png|like the photograph shown him , with
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s01-03.png|a man " very close in conversation and
data/segments/f04/f04-093/f04-093-s01-04.png|walking arm in arm . "
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s00-00.png|A guard reported that at East Croydon
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s00-01.png|he had seen what was accepted as the
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s00-02.png|same couple sitting close together in
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s00-03.png|a first-class compartment of the
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s00-04.png|train from London Bridge of which
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s00-05.png|he was in charge .
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s01-00.png|The two could
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s01-01.png|have joined this train by taking
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s01-02.png|one from Victoria and changing
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s01-03.png|at East Croydon .
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s02-00.png|He also believed
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s02-01.png|that they had still been together at
data/segments/f04/f04-096/f04-096-s02-02.png|South Croydon , and he remembered
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s00-00.png|Medical evidence established that Mary
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s00-01.png|Money had been dead for about an
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s00-02.png|hour before her body was discovered ,
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s00-03.png|and this matched reasonably well with
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s00-04.png|the timetable of the train in question .
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s01-00.png|More important evidence came from a
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s01-01.png|signalman at Purley Oaks , who had
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s01-02.png|seen , as the train passed his box , a
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s01-03.png|couple struggling in a first-class
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s01-04.png|compartment ; but he seemed to have
data/segments/f04/f04-100/f04-100-s01-05.png|been used to seeing couples engaged in

data/segments/f07/f07-002/f07-002-s02-01.png|many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly
data/segments/f07/f07-002/f07-002-s02-02.png|hide , did our forebears home from the chase
data/segments/f07/f07-002/f07-002-s02-03.png|hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of

data/segments/f07/f07-006/f07-006-s01-00.png|Later came the thrifty peasant ,

data/segments/g01/g01-019/g01-019-s00-03.png|of the French war was a navy in unquestioned

data/segments/g01/g01-019/g01-019-s01-00.png|It seems obvious
data/segments/g01/g01-019/g01-019-s01-01.png|that divided forces were dissipating the

data/segments/g01/g01-027/g01-027-s02-01.png|needed taxation in order to supplement

data/segments/g01/g01-031/g01-031-s00-01.png|was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
data/segments/g01/g01-031/g01-031-s00-02.png|substitute was the mutual self-help of
data/segments/g01/g01-031/g01-031-s00-03.png|communities , whether those communities were

data/segments/g01/g01-031/g01-031-s01-01.png|therefore in essence a forced payment whose

data/segments/g01/g01-031/g01-031-s01-03.png|and the vague advantages of military glory ;
data/segments/g01/g01-031/g01-031-s01-04.png|it was therefore always granted grudgingly

data/segments/g01/g01-034/g01-034-s00-01.png|booty , a new group of Lords might oust
data/segments/g01/g01-034/g01-034-s00-02.png|the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,
data/segments/g01/g01-034/g01-034-s00-03.png|who usually supplied the hard cash , might

data/segments/g01/g01-037/g01-037-s00-06.png|successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,
data/segments/g01/g01-037/g01-037-s00-07.png|journeymen and small tradesmen of the

data/segments/g01/g01-037/g01-037-s00-09.png|in the pay of landed Lords .
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s00-00.png|None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s00-01.png|expected to pay direct taxes .
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s01-00.png|During the four-
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s01-01.png|teenth century , the traditional methods of
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s01-02.png|financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s02-00.png|When the King and his Council required additio-
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s02-01.png|nal funds , they were usually granted an
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s02-02.png|export tax on the wool trade , collected by
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s02-03.png|means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s02-04.png|prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-
data/segments/g01/g01-039/g01-039-s02-05.png|pervised and controlled , together with a
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-00.png|There were two other sources of public revenue -
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-01.png|first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-02.png|of the Commons and in its own Convocations
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-03.png|granted equivalent contributions , and second ,
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-04.png|the foreign merchants , with whom the King's
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-05.png|officials had formerly made private bargains
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-06.png|at ' colloquies of merchants ' , and whose
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-07.png|payments were now authorized by parliamentary
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-08.png|sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
data/segments/g01/g01-043/g01-043-s00-09.png|excess of the rate for native merchants .
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s00-00.png|In addition to these revenues , the King had the
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s00-01.png|financial benefits of his position at the head
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s00-02.png|of the feudal system , as its chief landowner
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s00-03.png|and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s01-00.png|It was , therefore , a complicated and not very
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s01-01.png|satisfactory financial system in which the
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s01-02.png|borders between private and public purse were
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s01-03.png|as ill-defined as the borders between private
data/segments/g01/g01-045/g01-045-s01-04.png|and national war , and in which the comparati-

data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s00-00.png|But this time there was a very interesting
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s00-01.png|attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s00-02.png|payments demanded .
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-00.png|The definition of an
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-01.png|adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-02.png|and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-03.png|the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-04.png|of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-05.png|and between these two extremes a graduated
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-06.png|scale of payments was fixed for the
data/segments/g01/g01-067/g01-067-s01-07.png|different classes of laymen and clerics .
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s00-00.png|Again the resentment was widespread and
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s00-01.png|the results disappointing - a tax estimated
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s00-02.png|to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 .
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s01-00.png|In the following year , 1380 , the last and
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s01-01.png|most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s01-02.png|by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s02-00.png|There were dark reasons for a meeting so
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s02-01.png|far away from the capital in a town with
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s02-02.png|poor communications and not over supplied
data/segments/g01/g01-070/g01-070-s02-03.png|with hostelries and lodgings .
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s00-00.png|London was again in turmoil ; but this time
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s00-01.png|over a question of trade rivalry .
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s01-00.png|A rich mer-
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s01-01.png|chant from Genoa had been murdered , and
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s01-02.png|John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s01-03.png|those charged with the crime .
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s02-00.png|It is clear
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s02-01.png|from the chronicles that this was a sordid
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s02-02.png|quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s03-00.png|The city merchants were jealous of foreign
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s03-01.png|merchants who could tempt court and
data/segments/g01/g01-074/g01-074-s03-02.png|baronage with rarer luxuries than those
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s00-00.png|A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s00-01.png|to mediaeval eyes .
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s01-00.png|It was determined that 100,000
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s01-01.png|was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s01-02.png|two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s01-03.png|the remainder .
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s02-00.png|The method of assessment to which the
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s02-01.png|Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax .
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s03-00.png|The manifest
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s03-01.png|injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s03-02.png|corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s03-03.png|but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s03-04.png|weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
data/segments/g01/g01-083/g01-083-s03-05.png|had to pay three groats , but this time an adult was re-
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s00-00.png|Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s00-01.png|arithmetic which argued that , as the first
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s00-02.png|poll-tax had supplied 22,000 , a tax of
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s00-03.png|three times the rate would produce 66,000 .
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s01-00.png|The only concession made in view of the
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s01-01.png|objections to the first two poll-taxes was
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s01-02.png|the suggestion that the rich should help
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s01-03.png|the poor - but this was only a pious hope
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s01-04.png|because no machinery was provided for
data/segments/g01/g01-088/g01-088-s01-05.png|carrying it into effect , and a subordinate
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s00-00.png|In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s00-01.png|from the dissection of living animals , showing how these move-
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s00-02.png|ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s00-03.png|or in flagging warmer ones .
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s01-00.png|At the time of its movement
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s01-01.png|the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s01-02.png|its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s01-03.png|content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals
data/segments/g02/g02-059/g02-059-s01-04.png|such as serpents , frogs , and the like .
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s00-00.png|At one and the same time , therefore , occur the beat
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s00-01.png|of the apex , the thickening of the heart walls , and
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s00-02.png|the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s00-03.png|contraction of the ventricles .
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s01-00.png|Going on in Chapter Three
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s01-01.png|to the movement of the arteries , likewise gauged from
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s01-02.png|the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s01-03.png|contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s01-04.png|systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
data/segments/g02/g02-062/g02-062-s01-05.png|and of the artery-like vein , and expulsion of the

data/segments/g03/g03-043/g03-043-s01-00.png|George often spoke at the Sunday school .

data/segments/g03/g03-049/g03-049-s00-04.png|the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated

data/segments/g03/g03-064/g03-064-s00-06.png|understand socialism , though at this time
data/segments/g03/g03-064/g03-064-s00-07.png|he was a keen member of the B.S.P. .

data/segments/g04/g04-003/g04-003-s02-00.png|He seemed
data/segments/g04/g04-003/g04-003-s02-01.png|rather indignant , but we took the
data/segments/g04/g04-003/g04-003-s02-02.png|episode without a smile till afterwards .
data/segments/g04/g04-007/g04-007-s00-00.png|The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter
data/segments/g04/g04-007/g04-007-s00-01.png|when the distance to the church deterred many from

data/segments/g04/g04-007/g04-007-s01-00.png|We managed to furnish

data/segments/g04/g04-007/g04-007-s01-03.png|as for more secular purposes .

data/segments/g04/g04-007/g04-007-s02-01.png|was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert

data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s00-00.png|Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s00-01.png|work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and
data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s00-02.png|to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading

data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s01-00.png|This meant organizing lectures and courses of

data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s01-02.png|also found myself a member of the Diocesan
data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s01-03.png|Conference , where I remember introducing myself as
data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s01-04.png|the incumbent of the highest church in the
data/segments/g04/g04-011/g04-011-s01-05.png|Diocese .
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s00-00.png|There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s00-01.png|some quarters , until I explained that my church
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s00-02.png|was 800 feet high above the sea level !
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s01-01.png|work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s01-02.png|to get a stipendiary layman who could help
data/segments/g04/g04-014/g04-014-s01-03.png|among the children and young people .
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s00-00.png|It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s00-01.png|in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play .

data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s01-01.png|to play an important part in my life .
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s02-00.png|For five years in succession till
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s02-01.png|war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s02-02.png|very intimate with the people and the environs .
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s03-00.png|Every year between the
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s03-01.png|Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s03-02.png|performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would
data/segments/g04/g04-017/g04-017-s03-03.png|be discovered and trained .
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s00-00.png|After the First World War , 1914 , I did not visit
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s00-01.png|Germany for ten years , by which time in
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s00-02.png|1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s01-00.png|Towards the end of my five and a half years'
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s01-01.png|incumbency I was asked if I would start
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s01-02.png|a village choral society and conduct it .
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s02-00.png|This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
data/segments/g04/g04-022/g04-022-s02-01.png|into it .
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s00-00.png|First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s00-01.png|any idea of reading music .
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s01-00.png|This was the village doctor who was an
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s01-01.png|old school friend at Clifton .
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s02-00.png|He could sustain the tenor part quite well
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s02-01.png|and lead the others .
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s03-00.png|As for basses and altos the conductor had to
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s03-01.png|teach by singing the parts with them .
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s04-00.png|It was very amusing , and by
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s04-01.png|the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
data/segments/g04/g04-026/g04-026-s04-02.png|could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s00-00.png|Then we went to work on Coleridge Taylor's ' Hiawatha's
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s00-01.png|Wedding Feast . '
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s01-00.png|Enthusiasm grew , and in a few more months we
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s01-01.png|gave a concert at which the accompanist was the village schoolmaster ,
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s01-02.png|and the tenor solo ' Onaway awake ' was sung by the Rector .
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s02-00.png|Friends from Limpsfield , in addition to the villagers , came up ,
data/segments/g04/g04-032/g04-032-s02-01.png|and we were all happy .

data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s00-01.png|Vicar of St. Mark's , Woodcote , Purley , a new church built
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s00-02.png|by the well-known architect Mr. George Fellowes Prynne ,
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s00-03.png|who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s00-04.png|later on joint executor of his estate with his
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s00-05.png|solicitor cousin .
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s01-00.png|As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s01-01.png|ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held
data/segments/g04/g04-036/g04-036-s01-02.png|great family consultations .
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s00-00.png|My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s00-01.png|his family , and found a very suitable house nearby
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s00-02.png|where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s00-03.png|at the age of 92 .
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s01-00.png|Dr. Burge was not able to be present
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s01-01.png|at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s02-00.png|This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s02-01.png|Dr. John Leake , who lived at Blackheath , and was
data/segments/g04/g04-039/g04-039-s02-02.png|a close friend of ours .
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s00-00.png|But what a change from the dear little old church
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s00-01.png|at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s00-02.png|at Purley .
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s01-00.png|One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s01-01.png|church was , it had its own atmosphere , and for centuries
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s01-02.png|had been a House of Prayer .
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s02-00.png|I could not but feel the
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s02-01.png|chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s03-00.png|When we had found a group of people who gladly
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s03-01.png|co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
data/segments/g04/g04-043/g04-043-s03-02.png|of daily prayer .
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s00-00.png|I suggested to the congregation that it needed
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s00-01.png|warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s00-02.png|found many to help .
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s01-00.png|Gifts of candlesticks and
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s01-01.png|stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s01-02.png|helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s01-03.png|for prayer and quiet .
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s02-00.png|In time we received similar
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s02-01.png|gifts for the High Altar , and large East and West
data/segments/g04/g04-048/g04-048-s02-02.png|windows .
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s00-00.png|It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s00-01.png|such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s00-02.png|a rule that all gifts should be submitted for approval to
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s00-03.png|the architect , himself a fine artist .
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s01-00.png|It is quite possible
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s01-01.png|to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s01-02.png|and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
data/segments/g04/g04-052/g04-052-s01-03.png|table to the environs .
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s00-00.png|We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s00-01.png|the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses .
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s01-00.png|This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s01-01.png|there , but was soon changed into the better-
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s01-02.png|sounding name of Lansdowne Road .
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s02-00.png|There
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s02-01.png|were lots of children there , and we had
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s02-02.png|a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s02-03.png|service .
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s03-00.png|I soon saw that the parish needed
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s03-01.png|more help both at the church and Mission
data/segments/g04/g04-055/g04-055-s03-02.png|district .
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s00-00.png|The Church Army Captain had done very good work in the
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s00-01.png|Lansdowne Road district , but I needed more help in the
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s00-02.png|church for the full rota of services on Sundays and weekdays .
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s01-00.png|Most fortunately I was able to engage the Rev. E. U. Evitt in
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s01-01.png|1913 soon after I had come , and he organized the Mission
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s01-02.png|district and got to know , and be known by , many of
data/segments/g04/g04-060/g04-060-s01-03.png|the people of the parish .
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s00-00.png|A great blow disturbed all our efforts in the following
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s00-01.png|year , 1914 , when war broke out .
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s01-00.png|Very soon Chaplains for
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s01-01.png|the Forces were urgently needed , and I felt clearly
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s01-02.png|that one of us must volunteer .
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s02-00.png|The Bishop , Dr. Burge , did
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s02-01.png|not wish me to go then , as I had barely been in the parish
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s02-02.png|for a year .
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s03-00.png|Mr. Evitt , however , was much less committed
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s03-01.png|than his Vicar , and he was accepted at once and
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s03-02.png|was very soon in France where he did splendid
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s03-03.png|work until his health broke down and he had a bad
data/segments/g04/g04-063/g04-063-s03-04.png|attack of enteric fever .
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s00-00.png|Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s00-01.png|co-operation especially with the other Christian communities .
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s01-00.png|At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s01-01.png|' Coulsdon and Purley Patriotic Fund ' in whose counsels and committees
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s01-02.png|I found myself deeply involved .
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s02-00.png|At first , the main work was to help
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s02-01.png|wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s02-02.png|allowances , but soon , alas ! , as casualties began and increased
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s02-03.png|in the winter of 1914 and 1915 the matter of War Pensions
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s02-04.png|became very urgent , and I was asked to be Chairman
data/segments/g04/g04-068/g04-068-s02-05.png|of the Committee in Coulsdon and Purley .
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s00-00.png|Indeed , for the next seventeen years , during my time at
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s00-01.png|Purley , and from 1922 at Surbiton , I was continuously
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s00-02.png|Chairman of the local War Pensions Committee .
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s01-00.png|This
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s01-01.png|task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s01-02.png|the Committee .
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s02-00.png|We had a splendid body of local residents ,
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s02-01.png|and a series of excellent Honorary Secretaries .
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s03-00.png|Our
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s03-01.png|Committee met once a week in the evenings , and
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s03-02.png|included professional men from every walk of
data/segments/g04/g04-072/g04-072-s03-03.png|life .
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s00-00.png|Very soon we managed to get a hut in Purley where soldiers
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s00-01.png|were very welcome and the ladies organized a canteen .
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s01-00.png|Life was
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s01-01.png|in those years more than busy .
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s02-00.png|We now had a vicarage next
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s02-01.png|to the church , and I was most fortunate in having for eight
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s02-02.png|years a most able and devoted housekeeper whom I had known
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s02-03.png|well in Limpsfield where she had a house next to the
data/segments/g04/g04-077/g04-077-s02-04.png|church .
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s00-00.png|On hearing that I was to leave Tatsfield and come to
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s00-01.png|Purley she offered to come and look after me .
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s01-00.png|She was
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s01-01.png|a real treasure , of yeoman stock and clever in all domestic
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s01-02.png|things , a widow who knew how to look after the ' boy , '
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s01-03.png|who was the only other occupant of the house when
data/segments/g04/g04-081/g04-081-s01-04.png|Mr. Evitt had gone .
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s00-00.png|We gathered together a splendid Sunday
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s00-01.png|afternoon service at the church , each child
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s00-02.png|being given a number which , as they came into
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s00-03.png|church , they could just whisper to
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s00-04.png|the superintendent who filled in the regi-
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s00-05.png|ster at her own home .
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s01-00.png|Each child had a
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s01-01.png|picture given them and the lesson was
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s01-02.png|largely based on this .
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s02-00.png|It was on a
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s02-01.png|stamp which could be stuck in
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s02-02.png|their book , and there was quite a
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s02-03.png|clamour for back stamps if a child
data/segments/g04/g04-088/g04-088-s02-04.png|had to miss the Sunday Church from any cause
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s00-00.png|It was quite amusing to see how much
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s00-01.png|the children enjoyed the service , and I heard
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s00-02.png|of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s00-03.png|naughty child with the penalty of not being
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s00-04.png|allowed to come to the Children's Church
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s00-05.png|on Sunday afternoon .
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s01-00.png|I hope the threat
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s01-01.png|kept them good in the week , but anyway
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s01-02.png|they were a most delightful lot , and
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s01-03.png|it is a great joy to meet them now
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s01-04.png|fifty years afterwards when so many
data/segments/g04/g04-092/g04-092-s01-05.png|are parents or even grandparents
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s00-00.png|Speaking of churchwardens and children leads
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s00-01.png|me at once to chronicle a most intimate and
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s00-02.png|lasting friendship begun in 1913 in Purley and
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s00-03.png|continuing till old age to-day .
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s01-00.png|When I went
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s01-01.png|to St. Mark's , the first contact I made was
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s01-02.png|with the Vicar's Warden , Mr. F. W. Charlton
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s01-03.png|and his family , the youngest of whose three
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s01-04.png|sons was just coming into the world in this year
data/segments/g04/g04-095/g04-095-s01-05.png|of 1913 .
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s00-00.png|From then till now the acquaintance ripened into a very
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s00-01.png|deep friendship which I have taken with me through
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s00-02.png|all the many vicissitudes of a long ministry .
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s01-00.png|Mr. and
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s01-01.png|Mrs. Charlton have been from the first difficult
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s01-02.png|years of war , when most lives were upset and
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s01-03.png|some tempers were easily frayed , the most
data/segments/g04/g04-098/g04-098-s01-04.png|loyal and devoted friends .
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s00-00.png|Their homes - for since those years they have
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s00-01.png|lived on in Purley - have always been
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s00-02.png|havens of rest , and the welcome has never
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s00-03.png|failed .
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s01-00.png|Their three boys , now successful men ,
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s01-01.png|were in our Children's Church from the
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s01-02.png|outset , and when we don't see one
data/segments/g04/g04-101/g04-101-s01-03.png|another we do not forget .
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s00-00.png|In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s00-01.png|both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s01-00.png|The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s01-01.png|Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s01-02.png|at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners .
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s02-00.png|I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s02-01.png|frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s02-02.png|the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
data/segments/g04/g04-104/g04-104-s02-03.png|someone who knew their native villages .
data/segments/g04/g04-108/g04-108-s00-00.png|I could at once notice the great antagonism
data/segments/g04/g04-108/g04-108-s00-01.png|between the Bavarians and the Prussians who openly
data/segments/g04/g04-108/g04-108-s00-02.png|scorned these more simple country folk .
data/segments/g05/g05-087/g05-087-s00-00.png|Less than no response from the Russian side led

data/segments/g07/g07-042/g07-042-s00-02.png|been involved in a scandalous and ruinous

data/segments/g07/g07-042/g07-042-s00-09.png|in France to escape his creditors .

data/segments/g07/g07-044/g07-044-s01-01.png|down the rumours which had made the year of
data/segments/g07/g07-044/g07-044-s01-02.png|the Byron separation a nightmare to her , and she
data/segments/g07/g07-044/g07-044-s01-03.png|had also succeeded , though with an increasing
data/segments/g07/g07-044/g07-044-s01-04.png|sense of effort , in persuading her little world to
data/segments/g07/g07-044/g07-044-s01-05.png|avert its eyes from her husband , ' that drone ' ,
data/segments/g07/g07-044/g07-044-s01-06.png|as # Byron called him , whose career of
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s00-00.png|She had earned the right to be left in peace .
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-00.png|Byron's fame was , of course , very wonderful , but
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-01.png|it carried with it too many reminders of his
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-02.png|terrible indiscretions - the writing of Don Juan ,
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-03.png|which she had never ceased to deplore , his
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-04.png|shocking blasphemies like the Vision of Judgement ,

data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-07.png|mixing with really low and horrid people such
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-08.png|as the subversive journalist Leigh Hunt , whom
data/segments/g07/g07-047/g07-047-s01-09.png|on would never conceivably meet in decent society .
data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s00-00.png|She was most emphatically opposed to the
data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s00-01.png|production of sheer indelicacies , and that was
data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s00-02.png|the light in which she saw the proposed book
data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s00-03.png|by Dallas .
data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s01-00.png|Letters between a mother and a son -
data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s01-01.png|a son so outspoken and a mother so far from

data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s02-00.png|And brought out by that seedy poor relation ,

data/segments/g07/g07-050/g07-050-s03-00.png|Could anything be in worse taste ?
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s00-00.png|Hanson , the solicitor , was naturally remunerated
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s00-01.png|for his services , but all Mr Hobhouse's duties
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s00-02.png|as executor were performed without reward .
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s01-00.png|And now there was more trouble brewing
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s01-01.png|with those unbearable Dallases .
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s02-00.png|Dallas
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s02-01.png|senior was detained in Paris by severe
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s02-02.png|illness , but Dallas junior was full of
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s02-03.png|fight and applying for the injunction
data/segments/g07/g07-065/g07-065-s02-04.png|to be lifted .
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-00.png|He had gone to Byron's cousin , now 7th
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-01.png|lord , and had got him to compose an
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-02.png|affidavit to the effect that , whereas he
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-03.png|had formerly been reluctant to approve the
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-04.png|publication unless it had first been
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-05.png|examined by the relatives and friends of
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-06.png|his predecessor , he had now read the
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-07.png|book and was content for it to be
data/segments/g07/g07-069a/g07-069a-s00-08.png|issued without that precaution .
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s00-00.png|There were few things in Augusta's whole
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s00-01.png|life , full of calamities though it was , that
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s00-02.png|hurt her more than this contemptuous slight
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s00-03.png|from George Anson Byron , whom she had
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s00-04.png|loved with an unswerving loyalty , and had looked
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s00-05.png|on as her intimate friend .
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s01-00.png|Moreover , he
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s01-01.png|was without the right to make such
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s01-02.png|pronouncements : he had inherited nothing
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s01-03.png|from her brother but his title , whereas
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s01-04.png|she was not only of nearer consanguinity
data/segments/g07/g07-071a/g07-071a-s01-05.png|but the chosen recipient of his property .
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s00-00.png|These , if she had only known it , were
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s00-01.png|precisely the reasons why her cousin took
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s00-02.png|pleasure in the opportunity of annoying her .
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-00.png|Lady Byron did not like Augusta to have
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-01.png|intimate friends , and in every instance where
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-02.png|the occasion was granted her , she managed
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-03.png|to find some excuse for bestowing , in whole
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-04.png|or in part , those confidences which never
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-05.png|failed to leave her audience agape with
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-06.png|wonder at her magnanimity and Augusta's
data/segments/g07/g07-074a/g07-074a-s01-07.png|wickedness .
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-00.png|George Anson Byron had seen enough of
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-01.png|the poet's atrocious conduct as a husband
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-02.png|to be aware that Augusta , so far from
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-03.png|being responsible for the collapse of the
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-04.png|marriage , had been Lady Byron's greatest
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-05.png|support and comfort at the time ; but it
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-06.png|had been deemed necessary all the
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-07.png|same to enlighten him as to the suspicions
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-08.png|in the background , and he had repeated
data/segments/g07/g07-077a/g07-077a-s00-09.png|them to his newly married wife .
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s00-00.png|Their friendship for Augusta became rather
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s00-01.png|hollow , and the news that Byron had left
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s00-02.png|her practically all his money caused it to
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s00-03.png|crumble to oblivion .

data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-01.png|knew perfectly well that Byron , as early
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-02.png|as the year of their wedding , 1815 , had
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-03.png|made a will in Augusta's favour , she had
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-04.png|evidently not passed on that information ;
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-05.png|and it came as an appalling surprise to
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-06.png|Captain Byron that he had been left
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-07.png|without the fortune that would keep up the
data/segments/g07/g07-079a/g07-079a-s01-08.png|title .

data/segments/g07/g07-084/g07-084-s02-01.png|new Lady Byron , had said about it was written on the first half
data/segments/g07/g07-084/g07-084-s02-02.png|sheet of the same paper :
data/segments/g07/g07-084/g07-084-s03-00.png|My dearest Annabella , The more we

data/segments/g07/g07-084/g07-084-s03-02.png|we are convinced of the truth of that dreadful history
data/segments/g07/g07-084/g07-084-s03-03.png|connected with it .
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s00-00.png|Questions about marriage and children were
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s00-01.png|again included , as they had been at the
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s00-02.png|1911 and 1951 Censuses .
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s01-00.png|The former had asked
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s01-01.png|for marriage details for all married women ,
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s01-02.png|the latter for all married women under
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s01-03.png|the age of 50 .

data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s02-01.png|related to all women who were or had been
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s02-02.png|married , and so repeated the enquiry made
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s02-03.png|fifteen years earlier by the 1946 Family
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s02-04.png|Census conducted on behalf of the Royal
data/segments/h01/h01-000/h01-000-s02-05.png|Commission on Population .
data/segments/h01/h01-004/h01-004-s00-00.png|The questions about children were the same as in 1951 ,
data/segments/h01/h01-004/h01-004-s00-01.png|except that they extended to all women who were or had
data/segments/h01/h01-004/h01-004-s00-02.png|been married .
data/segments/h01/h01-004/h01-004-s01-00.png|It was not regarded as practicable within

data/segments/h01/h01-004/h01-004-s01-02.png|the date of birth of each child , as had been done
data/segments/h01/h01-004/h01-004-s01-03.png|in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission .
data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s00-00.png|The innovation at the 1961 Census , though the
data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s00-01.png|Family Census had previously included
data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s00-02.png|the question , was the date of termination
data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s00-03.png|of the first or only marriage .
data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s01-00.png|This enables

data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s01-04.png|whose first or only marriage was terminated

data/segments/h01/h01-007/h01-007-s01-06.png|of their child bearing life .
data/segments/h01/h01-010/h01-010-s00-00.png|This is particularly important in estimating the trends

data/segments/h01/h01-010/h01-010-s00-02.png|generations over as long a period as possible , as the
data/segments/h01/h01-010/h01-010-s00-03.png|proportion of widows predominates in the higher age

data/segments/h01/h01-010/h01-010-s01-01.png|on the ability to speak Welsh was included as

data/segments/h01/h01-010/h01-010-s02-00.png|The question was first asked in 1891 , and
data/segments/h01/h01-010/h01-010-s02-01.png|was given its present form in 1931 .
data/segments/h01/h01-014/h01-014-s00-00.png|Each census since the first in 1801 has included questions
data/segments/h01/h01-014/h01-014-s00-01.png|about housing and households .

data/segments/h01/h01-014/h01-014-s01-01.png|question was wider than before , because of the great

data/segments/h01/h01-014/h01-014-s01-03.png|Government and to local authorities .

data/segments/h01/h01-027/h01-027-s00-01.png|analysis it was not considered sufficiently
data/segments/h01/h01-027/h01-027-s00-02.png|important to attempt the task of bringing

data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s00-00.png|We have held eleven meetings .
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s01-00.png|We decided as a
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s01-01.png|first step to seek information from a number
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s01-02.png|of organisations and persons having an interest
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s01-03.png|in the questions before us and at a later stage we
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s01-04.png|arranged for publication of a press notice inviting
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s01-05.png|anybody interested to submit representations .
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s02-00.png|We
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s02-01.png|compiled a list of the points which we thought
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s02-02.png|were of importance , but we made it clear that
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s02-03.png|the replies need not be confined to these
data/segments/h02/h02-004/h02-004-s02-04.png|particular items .
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s00-00.png|As a general rule we did not ask for oral evidence , though
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s00-01.png|we found it an advantage in certain instances .
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s01-00.png|Appendix
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s01-01.png|1 gives a list of the bodies and persons consulted .
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s02-00.png|The
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s02-01.png|Department of Health for Scotland , the Home Office and
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s02-02.png|the Ministry of Health submitted evidence to us ;
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s02-03.png|officers of these Departments attended our meetings
data/segments/h02/h02-008/h02-008-s02-04.png|and have given us valuable assistance .
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s00-00.png|On 23rd November , 1959 , we submitted
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s00-01.png|an Interim Report .
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s01-00.png|This dealt with two questions
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s01-01.png|which arose from our terms of reference and
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s01-02.png|which had been brought specially to our notice .
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s02-00.png|First , we were asked to examine the risks
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s02-01.png|attending the abuse of carbromal and
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s02-02.png|bromvaletone and preparations containing these
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s02-03.png|substances .
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s03-00.png|The Poisons Board had already
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s03-01.png|considered this problem but , in the absence of
data/segments/h02/h02-012/h02-012-s03-02.png|sufficient evidence that these compounds
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-00.png|4 . On examination of the evidence it became clear
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-01.png|to us that carbromal and bromvaletone were examples
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-02.png|of a number of drugs on sale to the public which
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-03.png|were not appropriate for restriction to supply on
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-04.png|prescription under the Dangerous Drugs Act , 1951 ,
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-05.png|or the Therapeutic Substances Act , 1956 , and had
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-06.png|not so far been recommended for control as
data/segments/h02/h02-017/h02-017-s00-07.png|poisons .
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-00.png|5 . We recommended that , in general , any drug or
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-01.png|pharmaceutical preparation which has an action on the
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-02.png|central nervous system and is liable to produce physical
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-03.png|or psychological deterioration should be confined to supply
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-04.png|on prescription and that an independent expert body
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-05.png|should be responsible for advising which substances
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s00-06.png|should be so controlled .
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s01-00.png|6 . As an interim and urgent
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s01-01.png|measure , the Secretary of State for the Home Department ,
data/segments/h02/h02-019/h02-019-s01-02.png|on the recommendation of the Poisons Board , has
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-00.png|We are glad to note the action that has been taken
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-01.png|and we hope that arrangements will be made to ensure
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-02.png|that , as other preparations affecting the central nervous
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-03.png|system become available , they too will be brought to
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-04.png|the notice of the Poisons Board , or such other advisory
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-05.png|body as may in due course be appointed for the
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-06.png|purpose , to consider whether there are sufficient
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-07.png|grounds for restricting any of them also to supply
data/segments/h02/h02-022/h02-022-s00-08.png|on prescription .
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s00-00.png|8 . The second part of our Interim Report was
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s00-01.png|devoted to anaesthetists who become addicted
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s00-02.png|to the gases and vapours which they use in the
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s00-03.png|course of their professional duties .
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s01-00.png|We
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s01-01.png|ascertained that the incidence of this irregular-
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s01-02.png|ity was very small indeed .
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s02-00.png|However , over a
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s02-01.png|period of eleven years , patients' lives had been
data/segments/h02/h02-024/h02-024-s02-02.png|endangered in two known instances .
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s00-00.png|We were assured by our expert witnesses on this
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s00-01.png|subject that , with the apparatus at present to hand , the
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s00-02.png|preliminary sniffing of the gases immediately before
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s00-03.png|administering them to a patient was a recognised and
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s00-04.png|necessary precaution .
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s01-00.png|We accepted this .
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s02-00.png|10 . In view of
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s02-01.png|the heavy and direct responsibility carried by every
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s02-02.png|anaesthetist we were convinced that anyone addicted
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s02-03.png|to the inhalation of gases and vapours should never be
data/segments/h02/h02-028/h02-028-s02-04.png|entrusted with their administration .
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-00.png|The main tasks of the Rolleston Committee , whose advice
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-01.png|we were invited to review , were to advise on : ( a ) the
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-02.png|circumstances , if any , in which the supply of morphine
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-03.png|and heroin , and preparations containing these substances ,
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-04.png|to persons addicted to those drugs might be regarded
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-05.png|as medically advisable ; ( b ) the precautions which medical
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-06.png|practitioners administering or prescribing morphine or
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-07.png|heroin should adopt to avoid abuse and any
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-08.png|administrative measures that seemed expedient to
data/segments/h02/h02-035/h02-035-s00-09.png|secure observance of those precautions .
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-00.png|12 . Through the system of records and
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-01.png|inspection then in operation cases were
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-02.png|brought to the notice of the Home Office
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-03.png|at that time in which exceptionally
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-04.png|large quantities of morphine and heroin
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-05.png|had been supplied to particular practi-
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-06.png|tioners or prescribed for individual
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s00-07.png|cases .
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s01-00.png|On further enquiry it was
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s01-01.png|ascertained that sometimes the
data/segments/h02/h02-037/h02-037-s01-02.png|doctor had ordered these drugs simply
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s00-00.png|13 . It appeared then that in some circumstances
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s00-01.png|dangerous drugs were being supplied in
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s00-02.png|contravention of the intention of Parliament
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s00-03.png|that a doctor should be authorised to supply
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s00-04.png|drugs only so far as was necessary for the
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s00-05.png|practice of his profession .
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s01-00.png|Before deciding on
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s01-01.png|measures to secure proper observance of
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s01-02.png|the law , it was felt necessary to have
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s01-03.png|some authoritative medical advice on various
data/segments/h02/h02-040/h02-040-s01-04.png|aspects of the treatment of addiction , ...
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s00-00.png|The Rolleston Committee's recommen-
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s00-01.png|dations in 1926 on the supply of morphine
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s00-02.png|and heroin to addicts to these drugs and
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s00-03.png|on the use of drugs in treatment are discussed
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s00-04.png|later in this Report .
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s01-00.png|They have , up to now ,
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s01-01.png|been included in the Memorandum on
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s01-02.png|the Dangerous Drugs Act and Regulations
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s01-03.png|which is prepared by the Home Office
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s01-04.png|for the information of doctors and
data/segments/h02/h02-043/h02-043-s01-05.png|dentists .
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s00-00.png|The Secretary of State was empowered , on the recommendation of a
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s00-01.png|tribunal , to withdraw a doctor's authority to possess and supply
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s00-02.png|dangerous drugs and to direct that such a doctor , or a doctor
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s00-03.png|convicted of an offence under the Act , should not issue
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s00-04.png|prescriptions for dangerous drugs .
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s01-00.png|( 3 ) It was made clear
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s01-01.png|that prescriptions should only be given by a duly qualified
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s01-02.png|medical practitioner when required for purposes of
data/segments/h02/h02-049/h02-049-s01-03.png|medical treatment .
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-00.png|Nevertheless , average net family income
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-01.png|was appreciably higher in families with
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-02.png|several children than in those with only ,
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-03.png|many of which were incomplete families
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-04.png|of younger parents with lower earnings ,
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-05.png|and of course with lower tax reliefs and
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s00-06.png|no family allowances .
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s01-00.png|The rise in net family
data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s01-01.png|incomes between 1954 and 1959 was great-

data/segments/h04/h04-000/h04-000-s01-03.png|couples ( probably because of the

data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s00-00.png|There is , however , a danger that workers
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s00-01.png|will rely too much on fixed devices because
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s00-02.png|they fail to recognise their limitations .
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-00.png|It is therefore safer both in principle and
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-01.png|practice to keep the worker away from
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-02.png|overhead lines wherever possible , e.g. , by
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-03.png|( 1 ) re-routing the line , ( 2 ) putting the supply
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-04.png|underground , ( 3 ) making the line
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-05.png|dead ( after consultation with the supply
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-06.png|authority ) , ( 4 ) providing barriers at a safe
data/segments/h06/h06-082/h06-082-s01-07.png|distance to prevent vehicles from approaching
data/segments/h06/h06-085/h06-085-s00-00.png|It is also important to remember that on

data/segments/h06/h06-085/h06-085-s02-03.png|forward between two platens , the upper

data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s00-00.png|The lower platen , which supports the
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s00-01.png|leather , is raised hydraulically to bring
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s00-02.png|it into contact with the rollers on the upper
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s00-03.png|platen , which is then caused to make
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s00-04.png|several horizontal oscillations so that the
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s00-05.png|leather is rolled and pressed at the same time .
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s01-00.png|The danger zone between the platens is fenced
data/segments/h06/h06-089/h06-089-s01-01.png|by a guard which is interlocked with the

data/segments/h07/h07-003/h07-003-s02-03.png|showed that 5 per cent of the staff were classed as

data/segments/j07/j07-005/j07-005-s00-00.png|The air passages were packed with corrugated
data/segments/j07/j07-005/j07-005-s00-01.png|foil bonded to the primary plates to

data/segments/j07/j07-005/j07-005-s01-00.png|The narrower coolant passages were also packed with foil ,
data/segments/j07/j07-005/j07-005-s01-01.png|chiefly to provide sufficient support for the flat plates to withstand

data/segments/k01/k01-051/k01-051-s02-00.png|They had
data/segments/k01/k01-051/k01-051-s02-01.png|no office hours , however elastic ; their lives were
data/segments/k01/k01-051/k01-051-s02-02.png|spent in committee making decisions for others
data/segments/k01/k01-051/k01-051-s02-03.png|to execute on the basis of data laboriously

data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s00-02.png|or rather , on Nigel and myself .
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s01-00.png|Lee , I
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s01-01.png|noticed , had asked for Coca-Cola .
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s02-00.png|This
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s02-01.png|rather surprised me from a young man
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s02-02.png|who was otherwise so sophisticated .
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s03-00.png|He
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s03-01.png|was not , however , ostentatious about
data/segments/k02/k02-018/k02-018-s03-02.png|the matter .
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s00-00.png|If anything , he had merely become a little more reserved , and
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s00-01.png|much more polite .
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s01-00.png|I thought to myself :
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s02-00.png|' A few years in the

data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s03-00.png|After the curry , I wanted only to go upstairs to
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s03-01.png|bed .
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s04-00.png|I had long since become accustomed , and now addicted ,
data/segments/k02/k02-023/k02-023-s04-01.png|to an after-curry nap .

data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s00-00.png|Lee , however , showed not the slightest sign of fatigue .
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s01-00.png|' I
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s01-01.png|wonder if you 'd mind if I took a bit of a look round , '
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s01-02.png|he asked Nigel .
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s02-00.png|' I don't sleep in the afternoons . '
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s03-00.png|Nigel ,
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s03-01.png|I must say , was very good about it .
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s04-00.png|I knew how much
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s04-01.png|he probably wanted to sleep himself .
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s05-00.png|But , almost
data/segments/k02/k02-029/k02-029-s05-01.png|gallantly , he said :
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s00-00.png|' Not at all .
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s01-00.png|I 'll show you . '
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s02-00.png|' Oh no , '
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s02-01.png|young Lee protested , considerate as always .
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s03-00.png|' That 's not necessary if you want to rest , sir .
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s04-00.png|I 'm sure I won't do any harm . '
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s05-00.png|Nigel
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s05-01.png|laughed .
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s06-00.png|I had not known he was so
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s06-01.png|good-natured .
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s07-00.png|But then , I suppose I had
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s07-01.png|never given him similar cause to display
data/segments/k02/k02-036/k02-036-s07-02.png|such amiability .
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s00-00.png|I slept soundly , and much later than I should .
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s01-00.png|It
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s01-01.png|was already after six when I awoke , and the sun
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s01-02.png|was nearly setting beyond the west window .
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s02-00.png|Downstairs I could hear the murmur of voices ,
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s02-01.png|and knew they were back .
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s03-00.png|I wondered , as I
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s03-01.png|wrapped a 6sarong around my waist , if
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s03-02.png|Nigel at all resented being deprived of his
data/segments/k02/k02-053/k02-053-s03-03.png|afternoon sleep .
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s00-00.png|And I said to myself :
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s01-00.png|Oh , God , doesn't the
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s01-01.png|boy ever relax !
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s02-00.png|He turned his gaze away
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s02-01.png|from me almost instantly , but it had
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s02-02.png|been enough to make me conscious of the
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s02-03.png|nakedness of the upper half of my body , even
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s02-04.png|of the matted grey hairs on my chest .
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s03-00.png|He
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s03-01.png|probably thought my appearance quite a breach
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s03-02.png|of the social graces ; but , naturally , he said
data/segments/k02/k02-062/k02-062-s03-03.png|not so much as a word about it .
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s00-00.png|' We 've just had tea , ' Nigel said .
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s01-00.png|' Would you like
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s01-01.png|the cookie to make you a fresh lot ? '
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s02-00.png|' I 'd rather
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s02-01.png|have whisky , ' I told him .
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s03-00.png|' Thought as much .
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s04-00.png|Sun 's nearly below the yard-arm , anyway .
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s05-00.png|Wouldn't mind a stengah myself .
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s06-00.png|How about
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s06-01.png|you , Harry ? '
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s07-00.png|So they had managed to come
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s07-01.png|to the stage of using each other's Christian
data/segments/k02/k02-067/k02-067-s07-02.png|names , I noted .
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s00-00.png|Perhaps Lee wasn't quite as
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s00-01.png|reserved as I thought .
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s01-00.png|' Thanks ,
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s01-01.png|Nigel , ' he said .
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s02-00.png|' Just Coca-Cola .
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s03-00.png|Although I 'd like to have
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s03-01.png|whatever you have .
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s04-00.png|I want to
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s04-01.png|get to know the kind of life
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s04-02.png|people lead in the East , you know . '
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s05-00.png|At this , I felt a return of the
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s05-01.png|irritation I felt with him
data/segments/k02/k02-076/k02-076-s05-02.png|at times .
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s00-00.png|Knowing Nigel , I would have been surprised if he
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s00-01.png|had not made his usual ' arrangements ' .
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s01-00.png|A bachelor
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s01-01.png|himself , he knew well how to entertain his bachelor
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s01-02.png|friends .
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s02-00.png|He caught my look and pursed his lips in
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s02-01.png|a quick little grimace of acknowledgement ; then raised
data/segments/k02/k02-093/k02-093-s02-02.png|an enquiring eyebrow in young Lee's direction .
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s00-00.png|I shrugged a shoulder .
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-00.png|Lee would have
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-01.png|to decide about that for himself , I
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-02.png|thought , and noticed that although he
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-03.png|was looking at the other girl , he did
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-04.png|so quite dispassionately , almost as though
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-05.png|he was merely interested in the unfamiliar
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s01-06.png|clothes she was wearing .
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s02-00.png|And I thought
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s02-01.png|to myself :
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s03-00.png|He may be still too much of
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s03-01.png|a ' new chum ' to see ' the beauty of
data/segments/k02/k02-097/k02-097-s03-02.png|the East ' .
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s00-00.png|There was still an ease in our conversation , but its
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s00-01.png|scope was restricted .
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s01-00.png|I felt that I could hardly make the
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s01-01.png|usual enquiries and comments about Nigel's various mistresses
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s01-02.png|as I was accustomed to whenever I saw him , much as I
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s01-03.png|wondered which of his girls was in favour at the moment .
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s02-00.png|And I suppose he felt the same .
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s03-00.png|We had only a few drinks ,
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s03-01.png|then decided to bathe and dress for a rather early
data/segments/k02/k02-102/k02-102-s03-02.png|dinner .
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s00-00.png|He had one of the better Kashmir carpets on
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s00-01.png|the floor .
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s01-00.png|His pictures and curtains , indeed I
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s01-01.png|suppose the entire furnishings , had been se-
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s01-02.png|lected personally .
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s02-00.png|The house was , as he
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s02-01.png|occasionally proclaimed , his home - and he had
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s02-02.png|made it as such .
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s03-00.png|I doubt if he will ever
data/segments/k02/k02-112/k02-112-s03-01.png|leave Malaya , even when he retires .
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s00-00.png|The country , and his mistresses , have come
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s00-01.png|to mean too much to him .
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s01-00.png|And , indirectly ,
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s01-01.png|this impression I had of him was one of several
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s01-02.png|reasons why I had decided I should leave
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s01-03.png|it - before , for me too , it would be too late .
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s02-00.png|I used the excuse of our early start in the
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s02-01.png|morning to retire as soon as it seemed
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s02-02.png|prudent to do so , after the coffee and brandy ,
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s02-03.png|already anticipating the familiar pleasures
data/segments/k02/k02-117/k02-117-s02-04.png|awaiting me .
data/segments/k03/k03-117/k03-117-s00-00.png|After lunch two of the Prime Minister's

data/segments/k03/k03-117/k03-117-s00-04.png|gratefully from the table , leaving the two

data/segments/k03/k03-117/k03-117-s01-00.png|A nurse came in , and asked

data/segments/k03/k03-117/k03-117-s01-03.png|her away impatiently .
data/segments/k03/k03-138/k03-138-s00-00.png|I don't mean just our direct military costs .

data/segments/k04/k04-010/k04-010-s02-02.png|stairs , she became aware of someone
data/segments/k04/k04-010/k04-010-s02-03.png|watching her intently , and turning
data/segments/k04/k04-010/k04-010-s02-04.png|in that direction , she saw Olimpia ,
data/segments/k04/k04-010/k04-010-s02-05.png|standing beside her admirer , Orlando Cavalcanti .
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s00-00.png|The young man was bending over her with the
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s00-01.png|assiduity of a lover , but the girl appeared to be more
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s00-02.png|interested in her cousin's wife , whom she was regarding
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s00-03.png|through half-closed eyes .
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s01-00.png|This was a slight shock to
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s01-01.png|Vittoria , who had forgotten the existence of the girl ,
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s01-02.png|and , up to this moment had been unaware of the
data/segments/k04/k04-014/k04-014-s01-03.png|young man's presence at the palazzo .
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s00-00.png|' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s00-01.png|asked idly , tapping the girl's cheek lightly with

data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s00-03.png|the answer .
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s01-00.png|Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s01-01.png|was wondering whether Olimpia had been
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s01-02.png|watching her talk with Orsini .
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s02-00.png|Surely she
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s02-01.png|could not have overheard anything they
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s02-02.png|said ?
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s03-00.png|A moment's reflection reassured her
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s03-01.png|on that point , for she was certain no one
data/segments/k04/k04-017/k04-017-s03-02.png|had been standing near them .
data/segments/k04/k04-022/k04-022-s00-00.png|However , something inimical in the girl's look
data/segments/k04/k04-022/k04-022-s00-01.png|put Vittoria on guard .

data/segments/k04/k04-022/k04-022-s03-01.png|stopping on the way , to point out , with childish pride ,

data/segments/k04/k04-022/k04-022-s04-00.png|Vittoria , on the
data/segments/k04/k04-022/k04-022-s04-01.png|fringe of the party , caught snatches of this
data/segments/k04/k04-022/k04-022-s04-02.png|information , which held no interest for her :

data/segments/k04/k04-033/k04-033-s01-01.png|where they dispersed and wandered around , admiring
data/segments/k04/k04-033/k04-033-s01-02.png|and commenting on the glowing hues and barbaric
data/segments/k04/k04-033/k04-033-s01-03.png|splendours of the tapestries Doria had brought
data/segments/k04/k04-033/k04-033-s01-04.png|back from Lepanto .

data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s00-00.png|With a swift gesture she closed her fan
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s00-01.png|and moved away from him towards the group
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s00-02.png|in the centre of the gallery , leaving him standing
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s00-03.png|alone , against that glowing , barbaric background ,
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s00-04.png|with a deeply thoughtful expression on his face .
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s01-00.png|On a bright unclouded morning a few days after
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s01-01.png|the visit to the Doria Palace , the cardinal's
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s01-02.png|coach left the villa , lurched over the unpaved
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s01-03.png|track and turned towards the ruined Baths
data/segments/k04/k04-054/k04-054-s01-04.png|of Diocletian .
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s00-00.png|Vittoria , accompanied by her maid , Lucia , was on her
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s00-01.png|way to the Accoramboni villa , ostensibly to pay
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s00-02.png|a daughterly call on her father , actually to coax
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s00-03.png|money from that indulgent parent to settle her mounting
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s00-04.png|debts .
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s01-00.png|Lucia was thinking how beautiful her mistress

data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s01-02.png|with its underskirt of rose-brocade fitted her
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s01-03.png|perfect figure .
data/segments/k04/k04-057/k04-057-s02-00.png|Vittoria's thoughts were more complex .
data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s00-00.png|The sparkling society of the Doria Palace , the flattery

data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s00-03.png|of her grey life with the splendid one that filled
data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s00-04.png|her dreams .
data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s01-00.png|At the Villa Montalto she felt an alien ,
data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s01-01.png|and although she had repeatedly urged Francesco

data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s01-03.png|pleaded his financial dependence on his uncle , who
data/segments/k04/k04-061/k04-061-s01-04.png|had built the villa for his family .
data/segments/k04/k04-064/k04-064-s00-00.png|He reminded her that they must abide by Roman

data/segments/k04/k04-064/k04-064-s01-01.png|values were those of the materialist who assesses
data/segments/k04/k04-064/k04-064-s01-02.png|every human being in terms of fame , power and
data/segments/k04/k04-064/k04-064-s01-03.png|wealth .
data/segments/k04/k04-064/k04-064-s02-00.png|Francesco she despised for his dullness , his
data/segments/k04/k04-064/k04-064-s02-01.png|lack of initiative , his subservience to his uncle .
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s00-00.png|Her husband's gentleness and amiability , his unselfish
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s00-01.png|love for her , she regarded as signs of weakness .
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s01-00.png|He was a
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s01-01.png|futile creature who had not even proved capable of giving
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s01-02.png|her a child .
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s02-00.png|Whatever passion she had experienced in the
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s02-01.png|first months of marriage had been ousted by contempt .
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s03-00.png|She had never loved him .
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s04-00.png|Her thoughts rushed to Orsini .
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s05-00.png|Since the meeting in the Doria Palace , no word had
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s05-01.png|come from him , and this silence oppressed her spirits
data/segments/k04/k04-068/k04-068-s05-02.png|with a weight of misgiving .
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s00-00.png|She had , perhaps , demanded too much .
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s01-01.png|kiss in the garden had plumbed unsus-
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s01-02.png|pected depths in her , and she knew that
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s01-03.png|if she yielded to him , her passion could ,
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s01-04.png|indeed , match his .
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s02-00.png|Every instinct urged her to
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s02-01.png|surrender , for there was that in his nature
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s02-02.png|to which her own had responded as it
data/segments/k04/k04-075/k04-075-s02-03.png|had responded to no other human being .
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s00-00.png|Prudence , ambition and reason had
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s00-01.png|held instinct in check , and they must
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s00-02.png|dictate her course .
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s01-00.png|There could be no
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s01-01.png|compromise .
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s02-00.png|For a brief interval
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s02-01.png|she allowed herself the luxury of
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s02-02.png|dreams .
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s03-00.png|She began to imagine life at
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s03-01.png|Bracciano , the balls and fe*?5tes , the
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s03-02.png|conversation of poets and dilettanti .
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s04-00.png|She
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s04-01.png|visualized the pageantry of the tourna-
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s04-02.png|ment , and herself on the ducal dais beside
data/segments/k04/k04-079/k04-079-s04-03.png|Orsini , placing a chaplet of roses on the brows
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s00-00.png|This reverie was rudely ended as the coach gave a
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s00-01.png|sickening jolt and came to an abrupt stop , nearly throwing
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s00-02.png|the two girls from their seats .
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s01-00.png|Lucia uttered a cry of
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s01-01.png|alarm .
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s02-00.png|' Look , madonna , we are surrounded ! '
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s03-00.png|It was true .
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s04-00.png|Men armed with pikes and daggers swarmed about
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s04-01.png|them and a lean , swarthy fellow was peering through
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s04-02.png|the window , grinning impudently .
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s05-00.png|' Santa Maria ! '
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s05-01.png|shrieked Lucia .
data/segments/k04/k04-085/k04-085-s06-00.png|' Banditti ! '
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s00-00.png|Vittoria now realized that they were outside
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s00-01.png|Santa Maria degli Angeli , and that except for a few beggars
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s00-02.png|crouching in the doorway of the church and exhibiting
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s00-03.png|loathsome sores , the area was deserted .
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s01-00.png|' They are not banditti ,
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s01-01.png|Lucia , ' said Vittoria , pointing to the badge on the man's
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s01-02.png|shoulder .
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s02-00.png|The words were clear .
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s03-00.png|' Beware my hug ! '
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s04-00.png|Lucia
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s04-01.png|stared speechlessly at the golden bear ; Vittoria swiftly
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s04-02.png|averted her head to avoid the impertinent glance
data/segments/k04/k04-093/k04-093-s04-03.png|of the retainer .
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s00-00.png|Her thoughts at this moment were chaotic .
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s01-01.png|coach now turned in another direction , towards
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s01-02.png|the wild and desolate region behind the baths .
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s02-00.png|It was sparsely inhabited , dotted with fallow fields
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s02-01.png|and terraced vineyards , and here and there jutted
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s02-02.png|a brown outcrop of flower-wreathed ruins , a pathetic
data/segments/k04/k04-099/k04-099-s02-03.png|reminder of Rome's former greatness .
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s00-00.png|In this region of Monti most of the public baths
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s00-01.png|had been built in the time of the Caesars , but with the
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s00-02.png|breaking of the aqueducts during the barbarian invasions
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s00-03.png|the baths had lost their purpose ; they had become
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s00-04.png|stone quarries and their precious marble had been
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s00-05.png|burnt for lime .
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s01-00.png|Now escaped criminals and bandits
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s01-01.png|used these quarries as hiding places , to the danger
data/segments/k04/k04-103/k04-103-s01-02.png|of travellers in the district .
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s00-00.png|As they lumbered past at a rattling pace , Vittoria
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s00-01.png|could see a wisp of smoke curling above the fire of a
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s00-02.png|gypsy encampment and a few tatterdemalion creatures
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s00-03.png|gathered about it , cooking their frugal meal .
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s01-00.png|These
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s01-01.png|were left far behind .
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s02-00.png|An old man belabouring an
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s02-01.png|overladen donkey , and a withered crone appeared
data/segments/k04/k04-106/k04-106-s02-02.png|on the horizon , were overtaken and forgotten .
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s00-00.png|Except for their escort , Vittoria and
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s00-01.png|Lucia might have been the only living
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s00-02.png|creatures on an empty planet .
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s01-00.png|After the
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s01-01.png|initial shock , Vittoria felt calm .
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s02-00.png|She
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s02-01.png|knew exactly what she wanted , and
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s02-02.png|was prepared to take it without scruple ,
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s02-03.png|if she could .
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s03-00.png|What she had forgotten
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s03-01.png|in her self-absorption in her own schemes
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s03-02.png|was that other people were equally absorbed
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s03-03.png|in their schemes , which were likely to
data/segments/k04/k04-110/k04-110-s03-04.png|run counter to her own .
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s00-00.png|This move today was a reminder of that fact .
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s01-00.png|Whilst she automatically patted the hand of
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s01-01.png|the agitated Lucia , her brain was working
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s01-02.png|rapidly , and she decided that she must be
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s01-03.png|prepared to counter Orsini's demands ,
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s01-04.png|difficult though that would be .
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s02-00.png|She became
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s02-01.png|aware that the pace was slackening ;
data/segments/k04/k04-115/k04-115-s02-02.png|now the coach stopped .
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s00-00.png|The moment had come .
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s01-00.png|Upon the ensuing interview
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s01-01.png|the future would depend .
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s02-00.png|Outwardly she was calm , but
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s02-01.png|her heart was beating fast , and the palms of her
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s02-02.png|hands were damp .
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s03-00.png|Orsini's high-crowned hat with
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s03-01.png|its jaunty plume blotted out the light ; his hand
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s03-02.png|was on the door .
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s04-00.png|Glancing at Lucia he said in
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s04-01.png|French to Vittoria :
data/segments/k04/k04-119/k04-119-s05-00.png|' Your maid ... is she reliable ? '
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s00-00.png|She shrugged her shoulders , and replied in the same
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s00-01.png|language :
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s01-00.png|' Yes .
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s02-00.png|But make it worth her while . '
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s03-00.png|' I see .
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s04-00.png|I know how to deal with people like that , '
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s04-01.png|and turning to the cowering Lucia , he spoke in her
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s04-02.png|own language .
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s05-00.png|' Do you know who I am ? '
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s06-00.png|' No ,
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s06-01.png|signor , ' she whispered .
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s07-00.png|' I am the Orsini .
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s08-00.png|My word is
data/segments/k04/k04-126/k04-126-s08-01.png|law in Rome . '
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s00-00.png|Lucia was regarding him as a rabbit looks at a stoat .
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s01-00.png|Thrusting his head farther into the coach , he said
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s01-01.png|sombrely :
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s02-00.png|' Have you ever heard of a punishment called
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s02-01.png|the cord ? '
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s03-00.png|She blanched and shrank away .
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s04-00.png|Was there not
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s04-01.png|a street near Sant' Angelo called the Lane of the Corda
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s04-02.png|where criminals were hoisted by their wrists forty , fifty ,
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s04-03.png|sixty feet into the air , and dropped again and again , until
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s04-04.png|their arms were wrenched from their sockets . ' You have
data/segments/k04/k04-136/k04-136-s04-05.png|heard of it ?
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s00-00.png|The Orsini give that to traitors .
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s01-00.png|There is
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s01-01.png|no escaping the vengeance of an Orsini .
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s02-00.png|We hunt
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s02-01.png|a traitor down to the ends of the earth , and no
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s02-02.png|power can save him ... or her .
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s03-00.png|Do you understand ? '
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s04-00.png|' Yes , signor , ' she faltered .
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s05-00.png|' On the other hand , ' he
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s05-01.png|continued , giving her a keen look , ' the Orsini are
data/segments/k04/k04-142/k04-142-s05-02.png|generous to those who serve them faithfully .
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s00-00.png|Remember that , my girl . '
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s01-00.png|Lucia was beyond
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s01-01.png|speech .
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s02-00.png|He turned to Vittoria , sitting erect ,
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s02-01.png|with flushed cheeks and eyes sparkling with
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s02-02.png|anger .
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s03-00.png|' And now , madonna , ' he said smoothly , ' we will
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s03-01.png|continue the conversation started at the Doria
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s03-02.png|Palace .
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s04-00.png|Be pleased to alight . '
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s05-00.png|' I think , ' she replied
data/segments/k04/k04-149/k04-149-s05-01.png|coolly , ' I prefer to stay where I am . '
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s00-00.png|' In that case , ' he reverted to French , ' I shall be obliged
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s00-01.png|to lift you from the coach . '
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s01-00.png|Without answering him , she
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s01-01.png|rose , and bending over the agitated girl , said softly :
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s02-00.png|' No one will harm you , Lucia .
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s03-00.png|Remain here . '
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s04-00.png|Ignoring his
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s04-01.png|proffered hand , she stepped from the vehicle .
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s05-00.png|' Will you
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s05-01.png|be so good as to order your men not to molest my
data/segments/k04/k04-156/k04-156-s05-02.png|maid , ' she said coldly to Orsini .

data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s00-01.png|nevertheless , to the man who had peered into the
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s00-02.png|coach , whom he had addressed as Luigi , and gave him sharp
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s00-03.png|instructions on the matter .
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s01-00.png|Vittoria stood looking about her ,
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s01-01.png|breathing the scent of thyme .
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s02-00.png|The land at her feet sloped
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s02-01.png|away into a tiny valley beyond which , on the crest
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s02-02.png|of a wooded hill-side , the ruins of a small temple
data/segments/k04/k04-163/k04-163-s02-03.png|were etched against the clear blue of the sky .
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s00-00.png|He forgot time and place .
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s01-00.png|He , the master , was gently
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s01-01.png|led along erotic paths which he knew existed , but
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s01-02.png|had never trodden .
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-00.png|He learned how to use his
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-01.png|hands , how to adore that body without haste , how
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-02.png|to caress every inch with his mouth as well , to
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-03.png|creep down along her smooth muscles till he lost
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-04.png|himself in a rapture of kisses in places he 'd
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-05.png|dreamed of , where life began to ooze and quickened
data/segments/k07/k07-059a/k07-059a-s02-06.png|his heart beat to a thunder .
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s00-00.png|He looked at her .
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s01-00.png|Head thrown back in a pool of hair ,
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s01-01.png|her blood-red lips parted and the beating of her
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s01-02.png|heart in the full throat .
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s02-00.png|Her mouth did things he
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s02-01.png|thought no human being could stand without
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s02-02.png|dying , but he went on living in an ocean of
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s02-03.png|voluptuousness , that swelled and ebbed over him ,
data/segments/k07/k07-063a/k07-063a-s02-04.png|under him , in him and through him ...
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s00-00.png|He was having a ball !
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s01-00.png|He twiddled the TV set with
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s01-01.png|shaking hands .
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s02-00.png|She sat calmly on the bed smoking
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s02-01.png|a cigarette .
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s03-00.png|His face was white with two red
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s03-01.png|blotches .
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s04-00.png|Hers was flushed and lovely .
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s05-00.png|O.K. teacher !
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s06-00.png|Was that any better ?
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s07-00.png|You know it was !
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s08-00.png|You don't
data/segments/k07/k07-067a/k07-067a-s08-01.png|need teaching , only a little coaxing .
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s00-00.png|He sat down and ran his finger down along her
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s00-01.png|spine .
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s01-00.png|Do you love me now ?
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s02-00.png|Like yesterday !
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s03-00.png|I 'm
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s03-01.png|extremely fond of you .
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s04-00.png|The fact that you 're beginning
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s04-01.png|to satisfy my physical wants does not change that .
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s05-00.png|Before long you 'll give me the satisfaction that 'll set
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s05-01.png|me rocking on my feet , but I 'll still be only fond of
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s05-02.png|you .
data/segments/k07/k07-077/k07-077-s06-00.png|But you wouldn't marry me ?
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s00-00.png|No .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s01-00.png|I 'm not your type .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s02-00.png|I 'd make you miserable .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s03-00.png|I
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s03-01.png|mean that .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s04-00.png|I 'd very probably be unfaithful and
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s04-01.png|that 'd kill you .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s05-00.png|Then I 'd be unfaithful too , to teach
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s05-01.png|you a lesson .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s06-00.png|It wouldn't work .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s07-00.png|You 'd do it to
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s07-01.png|spite me .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s08-00.png|I would never do it for that reason .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s09-00.png|To me it 'd be immaterial whether you 'd retaliate
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s09-01.png|or not .
data/segments/k07/k07-085/k07-085-s10-00.png|You 'd go crazy if that situation arose .
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s00-00.png|To observe the colour rise in her cheek
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s00-01.png|and hear her breath come faster , to see
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s00-02.png|the slight beads of sweat come out on
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s00-03.png|her glistening skin and see her move
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s00-04.png|with uncontrolled rhythm .
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s01-00.png|To have her twist
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s01-01.png|in an attempt to receive a caress he was
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s01-02.png|purposely withholding , to hear her deep-throated
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s01-03.png|moan of full satisfaction and feel her
data/segments/k07/k07-122/k07-122-s01-04.png|shivering , clawing surrender .
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s00-00.png|Not so dusty , she might say afterwards , drawing at
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s00-01.png|a cigarette .
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s01-00.png|It 's a wow ! he said .
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s02-00.png|She kissed
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s02-01.png|him motherly :
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s03-00.png|You just wait till you teach the
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s03-01.png|girl you really love .
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s04-00.png|He didn't protest any more
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s04-01.png|to say he loved her because he knew it to
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s04-02.png|be untrue .
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s05-00.png|Instead he said :
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s06-00.png|Will that be
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s06-01.png|better ?
data/segments/k07/k07-125/k07-125-s07-00.png|She nodded :
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s00-00.png|It 's man's nature to teach and to teach those
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s00-01.png|we love is double pleasure .
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s01-00.png|And she
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s01-01.png|might add :
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s02-00.png|And don't forget to leave the
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s02-01.png|lights on .
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s03-00.png|You lose half the fun when you
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s03-01.png|fumble in the dark .
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s04-00.png|She had many direct
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s04-01.png|comments like that .
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s05-00.png|Once she quietly
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s05-01.png|pushed him back when he kissed her too
data/segments/k07/k07-134/k07-134-s05-02.png|fully and too soon :
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s00-00.png|Oi , not yet , you oaf .
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s01-00.png|What do you think my
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s01-01.png|mouth is ?
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s02-00.png|A billposter's bucket to be
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s02-01.png|plunged in at random ?
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s03-00.png|He 'd learned to
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s03-01.png|laugh when something went wrong or the
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s03-02.png|situation became ludicrous , as when they
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s03-03.png|were both caught in the raw when he 'd
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s03-04.png|forgotten to lock his door and Derek
data/segments/k07/k07-141/k07-141-s03-05.png|had walked in unexpectedly .
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s00-00.png|They 'd just had time to nip into the
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s00-01.png|bathroom and stood there shivering for
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s00-02.png|fifteen minutes while their guest was
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s00-03.png|smoking a cigarette waiting for him .
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s01-00.png|At last Derek got tired and left .
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s02-00.png|Just in time , erupted Charlie .
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s03-00.png|If he 'd
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s03-01.png|stayed any longer I 'd jolly well
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s03-02.png|have asked him to join us .
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s04-00.png|I 'm so
data/segments/k07/k07-146/k07-146-s04-01.png|darned cold I could do with two men .
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s00-00.png|You perverted sex-maniac , you wouldn't
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s00-01.png|dare .
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s01-00.png|Show me what you can do and
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s01-01.png|I 'll tell you if you need help .
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s02-00.png|Once he came back to the subject
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s02-01.png|of her marriage and asked her why
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s02-02.png|she was going to marry her sculptor .
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s03-00.png|Because I love him , of course .
data/segments/k07/k07-152/k07-152-s04-00.png|What do you think ?
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s00-00.png|But he 's a lot older , isn't he ?
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s01-00.png|I suppose so .
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s02-00.png|What attracts you ?
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s03-00.png|It can't be physical ?
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s04-00.png|Of course
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s04-01.png|not !
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s05-00.png|I love him for what he is
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s05-01.png|- he 's so great I 'm a bit scared
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s05-02.png|of him - a woman must be a bit
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s05-03.png|scared to be really in love .
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s06-00.png|That 's why you could never
data/segments/k07/k07-158/k07-158-s06-01.png|love me ?
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s00-00.png|Correct , ducky !
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s01-00.png|You just wait till
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s01-01.png|you meet the girl who thinks you 're a
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s01-02.png|god .
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s02-00.png|It 'll make you feel like one !
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s03-00.png|You think that sculptor 's a god ?
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s04-00.png|Perhaps , in a way .
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s05-00.png|All I know is
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s05-01.png|that I need him .
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s06-00.png|He kissed the
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s06-01.png|heart beat in her throat .
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s07-00.png|But how
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s07-01.png|about the physical side ?
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s08-00.png|You 're
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s08-01.png|quite an erotic little beast ; can
data/segments/k07/k07-166/k07-166-s08-02.png|he satisfy that ?
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s00-00.png|You youngsters always overestimate
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s00-01.png|yourselves .
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s01-00.png|You can take it from
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s01-01.png|me that he can and does .
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s02-00.png|But
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s02-01.png|even if he were impotent I 'd still
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s02-02.png|love and want him .
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s03-00.png|There are
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s03-01.png|sides to me you 'll never know .
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s04-00.png|Don't you feel guilty living with
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s04-01.png|me ?
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s05-00.png|Often !
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s06-00.png|Don't you ?
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s07-00.png|Mary had
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s07-01.png|married her bill broker some time
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s07-02.png|ago and he now shuddered when he
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s07-03.png|remembered the clinical weekends
data/segments/k07/k07-176/k07-176-s07-04.png|he used to spend with her .
data/segments/k07/k07-185/k07-185-s00-00.png|He often used to try to imagine
data/segments/k07/k07-185/k07-185-s00-01.png|her reactions if he had once treated
data/segments/k07/k07-185/k07-185-s00-02.png|her as he did Charlie , but his
data/segments/k07/k07-185/k07-185-s00-03.png|imagination failed .

data/segments/k07/k07-185/k07-185-s01-03.png|and told him to get down to

data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s01-00.png|He got in touch with
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s01-01.png|the woman Pete was passing off as his

data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s02-00.png|Starmouth managed to
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s02-01.png|win her confidence .
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s03-00.png|It seems that
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s03-01.png|she was an honest enough woman ,
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s03-02.png|only her mind wasn't as clear as
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s03-03.png|it could have been .
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s04-00.png|She showed

data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s05-00.png|He found out
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s05-01.png|that the name of her house - Grand
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s05-02.png|Greve - was taken from a bay
data/segments/l01/l01-000/l01-000-s05-03.png|in one of the Channel Islands .
data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s00-00.png|One of the small ones .

data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s02-01.png|used to have their holidays there .

data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s03-01.png|there .
data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s04-00.png|He dug out some people who remembered
data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s04-01.png|the family .
data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s05-00.png|In the end he pieced it all together .
data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s06-00.png|The Caxtons had two boys - Michael and Derek .
data/segments/l01/l01-007/l01-007-s07-00.png|Pete first met them at school .
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s00-00.png|It was a good school I sent him to , one of the best .
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s01-00.png|He was a boarder .
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s02-00.png|He could always turn on the
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s02-01.png|charm when it suited him .
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s03-00.png|The whole family
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s03-01.png|came to like him .
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s04-00.png|The real Michael - he was the

data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s04-02.png|was eighteen .
data/segments/l01/l01-016/l01-016-s05-00.png|Soon after that Pete staged his

data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s00-00.png|He was always a smooth liar .
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s01-00.png|He invented some
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s01-01.png|plausible story or other and threw himself on
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s01-02.png|the Caxtons' generosity .
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s02-00.png|They accepted him as a
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s02-01.png|kind of substitute for the boy they had lost .
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s03-00.png|Outside the family he began to pass himself
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s03-01.png|off as Michael Caxton .
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s04-00.png|The father was well-off
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s04-01.png|and easy-going .
data/segments/l01/l01-023/l01-023-s05-00.png|He was easy meat for Pete .
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s00-00.png|He sponged off him until he died
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s00-01.png|just after the war .
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s01-00.png|Then Pete had to
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s01-01.png|look around for some other
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s01-02.png|security .
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s02-00.png|He found it - Dackson's Wharf ,
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s02-01.png|and Dackson's daughter .

data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s03-01.png|other boy , Derek , had been killed in the war .
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s04-00.png|After her husband died her brain began
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s04-01.png|to fade .
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s05-00.png|At times she thought Pete was
data/segments/l01/l01-030/l01-030-s05-01.png|really her own son .
data/segments/l01/l01-050/l01-050-s00-00.png|My chance had come at last .
data/segments/l01/l01-050/l01-050-s01-00.png|I had to

data/segments/l01/l01-050/l01-050-s05-00.png|I told Starmouth to go at

data/segments/l01/l01-050/l01-050-s05-02.png|seen to Dackson and his daughter .
data/segments/l01/l01-050/l01-050-s06-00.png|He did as he was told .

data/segments/l01/l01-065/l01-065-s00-05.png|the previous Wednesday , and ended
data/segments/l01/l01-065/l01-065-s00-06.png|by admitting that he was in fact

data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s01-00.png|As he walked
data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s01-01.png|he concentrated on the problem of

data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s02-00.png|By comparison with the
data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s02-01.png|manner in which he had dispatched

data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s02-03.png|little spiv from Brighton seemed an
data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s02-04.png|easy undertaking ... once he 'd set
data/segments/l04/l04-062/l04-062-s02-05.png|his mind to it .
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s00-00.png|Back at the cottage he prepared his supper and ate
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s00-01.png|it beside the fire in the living-room , his thoughts once
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s00-02.png|more on Kitty .
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s01-00.png|If she was really in love with Stevie
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s01-01.png|Hewitt it was madness to go on worrying about her , he
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s01-02.png|told himself moodily .
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s02-00.png|Yet it was not as clear-cut as that .
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s03-00.png|He not only felt his need of her but was equally aware
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s03-01.png|of the necessity to help and protect her , even against
data/segments/l04/l04-066/l04-066-s03-02.png|her will .
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s00-00.png|Tonight , for the first time , he had abandoned all
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s00-01.png|pretence and shown her the honest desperation of his feeling
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s00-02.png|for her .
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s01-00.png|She had neither encouraged nor completely rejected

data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s02-00.png|In some perverse way their brief quarrel had forged
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s02-01.png|a bond between them .
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s03-00.png|No doubt she had every intention
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s03-01.png|of keeping both of them on a string .
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s04-00.png|On the whole he probably
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s04-01.png|had a slight advantage over the young man , inasmuch as he
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s04-02.png|had money to spend and she was a girl who had a healthy
data/segments/l04/l04-071/l04-071-s04-03.png|respect for the material things of life .

data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s01-00.png|But he was still no sort of match for a young
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s01-01.png|and virile competitor and he knew it .
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s02-00.png|He turned
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s02-01.png|away and begun to undress , shivering with the
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s02-02.png|cold .
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s03-00.png|His eye automatically glanced towards the
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s03-01.png|panel which concealed the hiding-place of his
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s03-02.png|secret treasure .
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s04-00.png|For an instant he stood
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s04-01.png|transfixed to the floor , his eyes unwavering
data/segments/l04/l04-082/l04-082-s04-02.png|as they riveted themselves on the wall .
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s00-00.png|Was it his imagination or was the panel slightly lop-sided ?
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s01-00.png|Leaping forward with a choked sound he grasped the oblong
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s01-01.png|panel and pulled it out .
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s02-00.png|The black tin box was exactly
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s02-01.png|as he had left it .
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s03-00.png|With heavily beating heart he reached
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s03-01.png|out and lifted the lid .
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s04-00.png|Everything was intact and he
data/segments/l04/l04-087/l04-087-s04-01.png|gasped with relief .
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s00-00.png|He lifted out the heavy bundles of notes and knelt on the floor
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s00-01.png|to count them .
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s01-00.png|Of course , he remembered being in a great hurry to get
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s01-01.png|that fifty pounds for Kitty !
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s02-00.png|Obviously he had been careless in
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s02-01.png|replacing the panel , but the possibility of anyone having
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s02-02.png|discovered his hiding-place gave him something of a shock .
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s03-00.png|As he replaced the bundles of notes , he withdrew the tin
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s03-01.png|box from its hiding-place and locked it inside the
data/segments/l04/l04-093/l04-093-s03-02.png|cupboard .
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s00-00.png|It would be safer under lock and key
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s00-01.png|for the time being than behind a piece
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s00-02.png|of panelling which did not fit very sec-

data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s01-00.png|Tomorrow he would buy a
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s01-01.png|heavy padlock for the box and search
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s01-02.png|for a new hiding-place .
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s02-00.png|He lay in bed ,
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s02-01.png|cold and uneasy , unable to account
data/segments/l04/l04-098/l04-098-s02-02.png|for an instinctive sense of danger .
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s00-00.png|When he closed his eyes it was
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s00-01.png|Henry Mansell's face he saw , hovering
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s00-02.png|above his head like a hideous caricature .
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s01-00.png|The
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s01-01.png|parrot nose and straight line of the mouth ,
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s01-02.png|the pitiless blue eyes that seemed to strip
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s01-03.png|him right down to his abjectly quaking
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s01-04.png|bones .
data/segments/l04/l04-102/l04-102-s02-00.png|The mouldering horror that had

data/segments/l04/l04-113/l04-113-s01-00.png|Hugh drained his glass and

data/segments/l04/l04-118/l04-118-s00-00.png|Roddy puffed at his pipe , his eyes fixed on the white-coated

data/segments/l04/l04-124/l04-124-s03-00.png|Obviously he met someone , either by chance or

data/segments/l04/l04-124/l04-124-s04-01.png|person had a gun and he managed to persuade

data/segments/l04/l04-136/l04-136-s00-00.png|It was impossible to associate him in one's mind with a

data/segments/l04/l04-136/l04-136-s01-00.png|Moreover he might well have been aware of his

data/segments/l04/l04-153/l04-153-s04-02.png|well , and he agreed that the missing cash is
data/segments/l04/l04-153/l04-153-s04-03.png|a hell of a mystery .
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s00-00.png|But as he quite reasonably pointed out the
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s00-01.png|money could have been disposed of in London
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s00-02.png|before your father left that evening .
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s01-00.png|It wouldn't be
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s01-01.png|unnatural for a man in his position to make provision
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s01-02.png|for an unknown dependent or settle what he regarded
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s01-03.png|as particular debts of honour before taking his own
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s01-04.png|life .
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s02-00.png|Also , logically , there 's nothing to show the
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s02-01.png|money couldn't have been pinched by someone
data/segments/l04/l04-159/l04-159-s02-02.png|passing the car after your father was dead .
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s00-00.png|Stealing from cars is about the commonest

data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s01-00.png|There 's nothing
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s01-01.png|that absolutely ties the missing money to the
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s01-02.png|circumstances of your father 's death , that 's
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s01-03.png|the point .
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s02-00.png|Same with the passport .
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s03-00.png|It 's gone
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s03-01.png|and that 's that .

data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s04-01.png|somewhere or at the back of a drawer .
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s05-00.png|As
data/segments/l04/l04-163/l04-163-s05-01.png|far as the police are concerned there 's nothing

data/segments/l04/l04-174/l04-174-s00-00.png|He wore a short white coat .

data/segments/l04/l04-179/l04-179-s01-03.png|crafty expression that failed to inspire confidence .

data/segments/l07/l07-074/l07-074-s02-01.png|held it in both hands , looking at me thoughtfully over the

data/segments/l07/l07-080/l07-080-s03-03.png|me , reminding myself that he could
data/segments/l07/l07-080/l07-080-s03-04.png|only have said such a thing
data/segments/l07/l07-080/l07-080-s03-05.png|because he did not know the

data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s00-00.png|I could meet you at the bus station . "
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s01-00.png|" No , " I said , " outside your office . "
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s02-00.png|I could not endure the thought
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s02-01.png|of another wait at the bus station .
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s03-00.png|He was there punctually .
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s04-00.png|Dressed
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s04-01.png|in a loud tartan shirt and abbreviated
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s04-02.png|shorts he looked hardly more than
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s04-03.png|a boy , a cheerful , good-natured
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s04-04.png|boy .
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s05-00.png|He settled me into the car
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s05-01.png|with touching care and then
data/segments/l07/l07-111/l07-111-s05-02.png|drove like a fiend along

data/segments/l07/l07-118/l07-118-s00-00.png|Ten minutes later he stopped in a lane
data/segments/l07/l07-118/l07-118-s00-01.png|and helped me out with the same

data/segments/l07/l07-118/l07-118-s01-01.png|I asked .

data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s00-00.png|Inside , she was untidy and grubby but
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s00-01.png|roomy enough and well lit by two rows of
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s00-02.png|good-sized windows .
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s01-00.png|It was a long time
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s01-01.png|before I got used to calling them
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s01-02.png|portholes .
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s02-00.png|The owner was a middle-aged
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s02-01.png|man whose family had tired of the
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s02-02.png|limited excitement of the river and now
data/segments/l07/l07-131/l07-131-s02-03.png|had their eyes on a seagoing boat .
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s00-00.png|Clive - he insisted on being called Clive -
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s00-01.png|haggled with him and within half an hour
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s00-02.png|Sandpiper was mine for three hundred and
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s00-03.png|fifty pounds .
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s01-00.png|When all the business details
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s01-01.png|had been settled and the owner had
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s01-02.png|departed with my cheque in his pocket ,
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s01-03.png|Clive started the engine and gave me my
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s01-04.png|first lesson in manoeuvring up and down
data/segments/l07/l07-135/l07-135-s01-05.png|the river and in and out of the other boats .
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s00-00.png|It was a warm , still evening ; the plop of
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s00-01.png|fish and the gentle putter of the engine
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s00-02.png|were infinitely soothing after city noises ,
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s00-03.png|and I began to look forward to my life
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s00-04.png|on the water .
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s01-00.png|At last he pronounced
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s01-01.png|me riverworthy and wanted to know when
data/segments/l07/l07-138/l07-138-s01-02.png|I would be moving in .
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s00-00.png|Like Clive , he was enthusiastic about the
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s00-01.png|engine and decided , apparently on the strength
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s00-02.png|of its efficiency , that Sandpiper was fit to
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s00-03.png|live in .
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s01-00.png|I was more than thankful for his help
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s01-01.png|when we had installed my things and the
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s01-02.png|boat began to move .
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s02-00.png|The river was crowded
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s02-01.png|with flocks of sailing boats which
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s02-02.png|swirled round us like gulls and there
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s02-03.png|were two locks to negotiate , but Max
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s02-04.png|seemed to know exactly what to do
data/segments/l07/l07-172/l07-172-s02-05.png|and at the same time kept me supplied
data/segments/l07/l07-176/l07-176-s00-00.png|" How on earth do you know all this ? " I asked
data/segments/l07/l07-176/l07-176-s00-01.png|him .

data/segments/l07/l07-176/l07-176-s03-02.png|one of the things I like about Max .
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s00-00.png|He has done so many things that there
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s00-01.png|is always something new and exciting to
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s00-02.png|discover about him .
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s01-00.png|" You 're wonderful , " I
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s01-01.png|said , meaning it .
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s02-00.png|He pressed the tip of my
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s02-01.png|nose with one finger .
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s03-00.png|" That makes two of us . "
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s04-00.png|It was about eight o'clock in the evening
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s04-01.png|when we tied up almost exactly opposite
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s04-02.png|Hardy's garden and went up on to the
data/segments/l07/l07-181/l07-181-s04-03.png|roof of the cabin to see what we could see .
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s00-00.png|From this side , Rivermead was less forbidding ;
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s00-01.png|it stood a long way back from the water
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s00-02.png|at the end of a velvety lawn flanked with
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s00-03.png|flowering trees and shrubs .
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s01-00.png|To the right of
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s01-01.png|the lawn , close to the water's edge , stood an
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s01-02.png|ancient boathouse shrouded in wistaria ; it
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s01-03.png|was built across a narrow backwater
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s01-04.png|and there was a delicate iron staircase
data/segments/l07/l07-187/l07-187-s01-05.png|climbing the outer wall to a room above .
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s00-00.png|" You won't see anyone tonight , it 's too late , " Max
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s00-01.png|said and turned to go .
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s01-00.png|" No - wait , " I put out a
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s01-01.png|hand to stop him .
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s02-00.png|The sun was no longer shining
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s02-01.png|and it was dark across there by the trees ,
data/segments/l07/l07-190/l07-190-s02-02.png|but I thought I had seen something move .
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s00-00.png|A shudder , more mental than physical , ran
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s00-01.png|through him , and his mind seemed to
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s00-02.png|melt away into emptiness .
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s01-00.png|His bulging
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s01-01.png|eyes caught the reclining form of Heather ,
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s01-02.png|who was still repeating in sing-song :
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s02-00.png|" ... I will not give in ... "
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s03-00.png|He stared at her
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s03-01.png|blankly , mouthing an incoherent gabble
data/segments/m01/m01-000/m01-000-s03-02.png|of half words .
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s00-00.png|He slapped himself in the face and
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s00-01.png|cuffed the sides of his head .
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s01-00.png|Then
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s01-01.png|by degrees the rotating objects
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s01-02.png|slowed , and coming into focus took
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s01-03.png|the form of the furnishings in Dan
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s01-04.png|Brown's living room .
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s02-00.png|He stood up un-
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s02-01.png|steadily and looked about the room ,
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s02-02.png|trying to gather his wits .
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s03-00.png|Outside the
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s03-01.png|dusk was settling over Dow's Lake and
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s03-02.png|the heights beyond were in
data/segments/m01/m01-012/m01-012-s03-03.png|silhouette , already a solid black .
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s00-00.png|He bumped into a floor lamp and
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s00-01.png|switched it on .
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s01-00.png|Heather McNabb still lay
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s01-01.png|on the couch , her body uncomfortably twisted
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s01-02.png|and afflicted with occasional spasmodic jerks .
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s02-00.png|He went to the kitchen for water and found
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s02-01.png|Dan .
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s03-00.png|Dan was lying on a long bench in the
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s03-01.png|breakfast nook , his head bent upright
data/segments/m01/m01-017/m01-017-s03-02.png|against the wall .
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s00-00.png|His usually animated face was expressionless and looked flat ,
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s00-01.png|as though his nose had been pushed back and his eyes and cheeks
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s00-02.png|brought forward .
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s01-00.png|He mouthed a low mutter , punctuated at intervals
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s01-01.png|with a few syllables of a crazy and incoherent jargon .
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s02-00.png|As
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s02-01.png|Steve looked at him his mouth suddenly snapped shut ,
data/segments/m01/m01-022/m01-022-s02-02.png|with jaws askew .
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s00-00.png|There was utter imbecility in his blank face .
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s01-00.png|Presently the
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s01-01.png|muttering started again , and went on and on .
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s02-00.png|Stunned and
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s02-01.png|shaken , Steve drew a glass of water and went back to
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s02-02.png|Heather .
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s03-00.png|Half an hour later Heather and Steve were still
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s03-01.png|trying to shake-off the last traces of hypnotic after-effects .
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s04-00.png|For several minutes they had been facing each other across
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s04-01.png|a low table , like two old convalescents thoroughly bored with
data/segments/m01/m01-026/m01-026-s04-02.png|each other through forced association .
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s00-00.png|Then something like a zest for living began to come back
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s00-01.png|to Steve and he squeezed her hand .
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s01-00.png|Her face took on
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s01-01.png|enough animation to produce a wan smile .
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s02-00.png|Dan's low mut-
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s02-01.png|tering was just audible from the kitchen .
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s03-00.png|And Steve
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s03-01.png|could see that as Heather recovered her senses and emotions
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s03-02.png|she was growing cold and numb with shock .
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s04-00.png|She had seen
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s04-01.png|Dan , or rather the physical relic of him - the empty
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s04-02.png|shell of flesh and bone , devoid of intellect and
data/segments/m01/m01-032/m01-032-s04-03.png|personality .
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s00-00.png|And these had been his great qualities ,
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s00-01.png|so attractive to her .
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s01-00.png|The Base Station had
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s01-01.png|gone before , discharging its narrow plane of
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s01-02.png|4ementalating energy along the length of
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s01-03.png|the Earth's imaginary longitudes , moving
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s01-04.png|eastward like a knife-edged twilight in
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s01-05.png|reversed progression .
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s02-00.png|It had brought the
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s02-01.png|First Stage in the Thetan pattern of conquest ,
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s02-02.png|the empty-minded receptiveness that
data/segments/m01/m01-038/m01-038-s02-03.png|prepared the way for the Second Stage .
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s00-00.png|He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s00-01.png|and came into the livingroom , where
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s00-02.png|Heather and Steve stood aghast at
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s00-03.png|his entrance .
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s01-00.png|He came , almost falling
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s01-01.png|forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s01-02.png|thrust out , arms dangling loosely .
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s02-00.png|Then , abruptly , he drew himself up
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s02-01.png|and walked on the very tips of
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s02-02.png|his toes .
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s03-00.png|He stretched his arms
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s03-01.png|over his head and yawned agape ,
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s03-02.png|drawing-in great breaths that
data/segments/m01/m01-049/m01-049-s03-03.png|became great sighs of ecstacy .
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s00-00.png|" They have come ! " he said reverently , gripping his
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s00-01.png|hands together between his knees and leaning
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s00-02.png|forward .
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s01-00.png|" Isn't it a glorious thing !
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s02-00.png|Long awaited
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s02-01.png|transcendent event , the exalted desire of all

data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s04-00.png|He turned beaming eyes
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s04-01.png|upward and shook his head slowly from
data/segments/m01/m01-060/m01-060-s04-02.png|side to side .
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s00-00.png|A superfluous precaution for there was no other car
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s00-01.png|abroad ; and no pedestrian to cross his path nor to wait
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s00-02.png|at an intersection for the light to change .
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s01-00.png|At his
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s01-01.png|apartment he garaged his car and then stood
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s01-02.png|listening in the night .
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s02-00.png|Listening in vain .
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s03-00.png|For the
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s03-01.png|earth had lost its life-tempo , as the heart
data/segments/m01/m01-079/m01-079-s03-02.png|loses its beat in death .
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s00-00.png|Deadly stillness , deadly portent !
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s01-00.png|Steve awakened early and switched on
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s01-01.png|the radio , which he kept tuned to CBO.
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s02-00.png|The set lighted-up but gave only a low
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s02-01.png|buzzing sound .
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s03-00.png|He had just finished
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s03-01.png|shaving when it came on , with a flat
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s03-02.png|voice repeating :
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s04-00.png|" This is BBC calling
data/segments/m01/m01-084/m01-084-s04-01.png|... this is BBC calling ... "
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s00-00.png|After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s00-01.png|went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s00-02.png|in Sussex , in all its obscene details .
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s01-00.png|Then the radio
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s01-01.png|went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s01-02.png|breakfast .
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s02-00.png|It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s02-01.png|should be .
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s03-00.png|Steve got out the car and traversed the
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s03-01.png|same empty streets as he had the night before ,
data/segments/m01/m01-090/m01-090-s03-02.png|to keep an appointment with Heather .
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s00-00.png|Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s00-01.png|Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop .
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s01-00.png|A
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s01-01.png|flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s01-02.png|the War Memorial .
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s02-00.png|There was a deep
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s02-01.png|whirring sound , and a high-pitched hissing
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s02-02.png|overtone that sang in his ears with an
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s02-03.png|almost painful sharpness .
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s03-00.png|He reversed and
data/segments/m01/m01-095/m01-095-s03-01.png|turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s00-00.png|The Thetans must not see him !
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s01-00.png|He took another route
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s01-01.png|to Heather's and saw two more flying saucers on
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s01-02.png|the way .
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s02-00.png|Heather was very anxious to visit Dan at
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s02-01.png|once ; but Steve insisted that they should first discuss
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s02-02.png|their situation , as far as it could be assessed ,
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s02-03.png|and to decide on what seemed to be the best
data/segments/m01/m01-100/m01-100-s02-04.png|way of meeting it .
data/segments/m01/m01-104/m01-104-s00-00.png|" The Thetans , " he said , " are presumably here to
data/segments/m01/m01-104/m01-104-s00-01.png|take charge , as it were , of the minds of the
data/segments/m01/m01-104/m01-104-s00-02.png|people - who are probably falling all over them-
data/segments/m01/m01-104/m01-104-s00-03.png|selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
data/segments/m01/m01-104/m01-104-s00-04.png|them out .

data/segments/m01/m01-110/m01-110-s00-00.png|There can be little doubt that if the

data/segments/m01/m01-110/m01-110-s01-02.png|move about pretty freely without

data/segments/m01/m01-110/m01-110-s03-01.png|are , beyond personal security ,
data/segments/m01/m01-110/m01-110-s03-02.png|I haven't a clue ; but , who knows ,
data/segments/m01/m01-110/m01-110-s03-03.png|we may form the nucleus around ...
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s00-00.png|" Now , to summarize what I think our
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s00-01.png|course of action should be .
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s01-00.png|First , to avoid the
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s01-01.png|Thetans like the plague , for they must not
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s01-02.png|find us out !
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s02-00.png|Second , to tread pretty warily
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s02-01.png|among our own people , finding out just how
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s02-02.png|much freedom we can take with safety .
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s03-00.png|And third , to study these damned Thetans .
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s04-00.png|We must learn all we can about
data/segments/m01/m01-115/m01-115-s04-01.png|them .
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s00-00.png|There is just a hope that we may uncover
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s00-01.png|some weakness , and find a way of fighting
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s00-02.png|back at them . "
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s01-00.png|Heather agreed , and suggested
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s01-01.png|that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s01-02.png|ting how the Thetan machinations had been
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s01-03.png|working out .
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s02-00.png|It occurred to Steve that this may
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s02-01.png|not have been entirely an objective suggestion
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s02-02.png|on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
data/segments/m01/m01-121/m01-121-s02-03.png|nevertheless .
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s00-00.png|So they proceeded to see if the coast
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s00-01.png|was clear .
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s01-00.png|The street was quiet and
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s01-01.png|deserted , and there were neither sight
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s01-02.png|nor sound of flying saucers .
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s02-00.png|So they
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s02-01.png|ventured forth and made their way on
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s02-02.png|foot to Dan's house .
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s03-00.png|Dan came
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s03-01.png|to the door at their ring but neglected
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s03-02.png|to offer any greeting .
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s04-00.png|He was deeply
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s04-01.png|preoccupied , and it seemed that the
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s04-02.png|ringing of a doorbell was to him
data/segments/m01/m01-125/m01-125-s04-03.png|a new and strange phenomenon .
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s00-00.png|When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s00-01.png|gave the impression of having been thought out and
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s00-02.png|decided upon .
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s01-00.png|Inside they sat down unbidden , while
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s01-01.png|Dan paced the floor .
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s02-00.png|He seemed completely unaware
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s02-01.png|of their presence .
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s03-00.png|They just stared at him , turning
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s03-01.png|their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
data/segments/m01/m01-131/m01-131-s03-02.png|down , up and down .
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s00-00.png|His whole attitude was a mixture of
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s00-01.png|impatience pending an awaited
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s00-02.png|communication and of a vague
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s00-03.png|perplexity respecting his surroundings
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s00-04.png|and the purpose he was to serve .
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s01-00.png|Finally , being so obviously on their own ,
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s01-01.png|Heather and Steve tried to make themselves
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s01-02.png|at home .
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s02-00.png|Steve switched on Dan's
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s02-01.png|powerful , world-wide radio and systematically
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s02-02.png|turned the tuning knob through all the
data/segments/m01/m01-136/m01-136-s02-03.png|tuning points of the world's great radio
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s00-00.png|They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s00-01.png|he waited .
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s01-00.png|The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s02-00.png|But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s02-01.png|the Avenue from its many tributary streets .
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s03-00.png|It might have
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s03-01.png|been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies .
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s04-00.png|First , it was Sunday morning ; and , second , everyone
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s04-01.png|walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of
data/segments/m01/m01-149/m01-149-s04-02.png|a single all-exclusive purpose .
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s00-00.png|After a long wait a bus appeared and they
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s00-01.png|followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s00-02.png|seats some rows behind him .
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s01-00.png|Steve was
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s01-01.png|beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s01-02.png|faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s01-03.png|Heather he found a welcome relief in her
data/segments/m01/m01-160/m01-160-s01-04.png|relatively long doleful one
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s00-00.png|Then he would go back to Plato for a final spell of
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s00-01.png|real days and would return to New York in late
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s00-02.png|January or early February .
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s01-00.png|Angelina might be a

data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s01-02.png|as arranged , but he consoled himself by
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s01-03.png|thinking that he and Angelina would have
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s01-04.png|plenty of time together in the future .
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s02-00.png|And
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s02-01.png|Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s02-02.png|back on Moon again , and able to do
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s02-03.png|research at first hand into matters on which
data/segments/m02/m02-048/m02-048-s02-04.png|the future of everyone , including Angelina , depended ...
data/segments/m02/m02-052/m02-052-s00-00.png|The recovery of his balance was due to the
data/segments/m02/m02-052/m02-052-s00-01.png|fact that he was living , virtually without

data/segments/m02/m02-083/m02-083-s02-03.png|by bragging how he had once won a trick from
data/segments/m02/m02-083/m02-083-s02-04.png|W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his
data/segments/m02/m02-083/m02-083-s02-05.png|rockets ( an admission which would scarcely help
data/segments/m02/m02-083/m02-083-s02-06.png|bluff to succeed the next time ) and , lately , by

data/segments/m02/m02-083/m02-083-s02-08.png|of the O.G.O. contingent in the Panama region ,
data/segments/m02/m02-087/m02-087-s00-00.png|But privately he turned out to be as friendly as

data/segments/m02/m02-087/m02-087-s01-00.png|One remembered that he was a lawyer
data/segments/m02/m02-087/m02-087-s01-01.png|by training , and suspected that the points he made
data/segments/m02/m02-087/m02-087-s01-02.png|so sharply in international politics were as abstract
data/segments/m02/m02-087/m02-087-s01-03.png|to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
data/segments/m02/m02-087/m02-087-s01-04.png|of law .
data/segments/m02/m02-090/m02-090-s00-00.png|The motive would be the same in both cases , to

data/segments/m02/m02-090/m02-090-s01-00.png|Here the rocket man's charm was disarming .
data/segments/m02/m02-090/m02-090-s02-00.png|Yet
data/segments/m02/m02-090/m02-090-s02-01.png|when the time came to leave , Harry felt as de-

data/segments/m02/m02-090/m02-090-s02-03.png|exactly a month ago .

data/segments/m02/m02-095/m02-095-s00-03.png|of free men everywhere , could only repel them .
data/segments/m02/m02-095/m02-095-s01-00.png|Then what of the cultural life ?

data/segments/m02/m02-095/m02-095-s02-04.png|which had grown up during the Moon's
data/segments/m02/m02-095/m02-095-s02-05.png|first two centuries ?
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s00-00.png|At the centre of each circle stood personnel
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s00-01.png|managers of corporations , together with professors
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s00-02.png|and their filing clerks .
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s01-00.png|The students had

data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s02-00.png|By comparing personal appearances
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s02-01.png|with university records , the agents of the
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s02-02.png|businesses would pick on young men
data/segments/m02/m02-102/m02-102-s02-03.png|and women who interested them , and contracts

data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s00-00.png|But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s00-01.png|or B in the finals next May , and since mating
data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s00-02.png|prospects would depend upon salaries , scholarship for
data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s00-03.png|these fine young people was closely geared to
data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s00-04.png|economic and biological ends which , essentially ,

data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s01-00.png|So , seeing them revolve in
data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s01-01.png|circles , Harry had the feeling that Moke ( or what

data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s01-03.png|way in Harry's mind ) had these splendid young
data/segments/m02/m02-106/m02-106-s01-04.png|people by the short hairs , and was diverting them ...
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s00-00.png|Stepping out in their white shorts , they looked glad enough
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s00-01.png|to be diverted , however , with the single exception of one
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s00-02.png|worried little man-student who kept getting out of
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s00-03.png|step .
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s01-00.png|He looked as if nothing Moke and his
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s01-01.png|minions could do to him would ever make him
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s01-02.png|GO ; but the reason probably lay in elementary
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s01-03.png|neurosis and not in some eruption from those
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s01-04.png|deeper layers in the human psyche which are
data/segments/m02/m02-109/m02-109-s01-05.png|trans-economic .
data/segments/m02/m02-112/m02-112-s00-00.png|So once again the metaphysics were depressing ,
data/segments/m02/m02-112/m02-112-s00-01.png|and in absolute contrast to the physical display .
data/segments/m02/m02-112/m02-112-s01-00.png|Mos have an un-American love of parades , and
data/segments/m02/m02-112/m02-112-s01-01.png|these young ones , on parade for jobs which they
data/segments/m02/m02-112/m02-112-s01-02.png|had to get to pay off their college bills , were naturally
data/segments/m02/m02-112/m02-112-s01-03.png|putting their best foot forward .

data/segments/m03/m03-114/m03-114-s02-01.png|so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and

data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s00-00.png|And a fine old fuss there was about it , too .
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s01-00.png|Here are the known facts .
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s02-00.png|On 10th July ,
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s02-01.png|the bus , the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl ,
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s02-02.png|left Dinas at two-thirty-five as usual .
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s03-00.png|Aboard , apart from the crew , were Mrs. Megan
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s03-01.png|Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ;
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s03-02.png|pretty little Morfydd Owen ; Mr. Stanley Hayball
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s03-03.png|and Miss Ethel Yates , hikers from
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s03-04.png|Birmingham ; Price the Provisions ; and the
data/segments/m04/m04-007/m04-007-s03-05.png|Rev. Edwards .
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s00-00.png|Yes , the bus set out from Dinas .
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s01-00.png|So much
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s01-01.png|is established .

data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s02-01.png|watched it go from the windows of the

data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s03-00.png|Very interested ,
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s03-01.png|Ifor was .
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s04-00.png|For there was his garage hand ,
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s04-01.png|Dai Pugh , taking a tearful farewell of
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s04-02.png|Morfydd Owen .
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s05-00.png|Morfydd , who had until
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s05-01.png|recently been Ifor's typist , but was now
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s05-02.png|returning to her home town as a
data/segments/m04/m04-012/m04-012-s05-03.png|fully-fledged schoolteacher .
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s00-00.png|" But I 'm only going fifteen miles away , "
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s00-01.png|Morfydd was saying .
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s01-00.png|" Not the end of
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s01-01.png|the world , is it ? "
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s02-00.png|" For me it is , " Dai
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s02-01.png|said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s02-02.png|overalls preparatory to a last embrace .
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s03-00.png|" You
data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s03-01.png|will not be remembering a mere garage

data/segments/m04/m04-019/m04-019-s03-03.png|the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . "
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s00-00.png|" Silly boy , " said Morfydd .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-00.png|Though she
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-01.png|could not help wondering whether , now she
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-02.png|had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s01-03.png|little Dai was quite the man for her .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s02-00.png|A nice boy of course .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-00.png|But perhaps in the
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-01.png|new world she was entering there might
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-02.png|be boys equally nice , and with far more
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s03-03.png|to offer .
data/segments/m04/m04-024/m04-024-s04-00.png|The conductor rang his bell .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s00-00.png|" Good-bye , Dai , " said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s01-00.png|" Good-bye , Morfydd . "
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s02-00.png|He sought to enfold her in his arms .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s03-00.png|But he was too late .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s04-00.png|She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s05-00.png|And Morfydd Owen
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s05-01.png|waving , unkissed , from the window .
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s06-00.png|And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
data/segments/m04/m04-030/m04-030-s06-01.png|heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s00-00.png|So the bus set out for Llangrwl .
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s01-00.png|But it never reached there !
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s02-00.png|Somewhere ,
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s02-01.png|on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s02-02.png|scene .
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s03-00.png|The first intimation that all was not well came when a
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s03-01.png|Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s03-02.png|Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
data/segments/m04/m04-038/m04-038-s03-03.png|damn bus .
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s00-00.png|" Left here all right , " said Ifor .
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s01-00.png|" Two-thirty-five , on the dot . "
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s02-00.png|" It 's
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s02-01.png|supposed to leave at two-twenty . "
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s03-00.png|" Who says so ? "
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s04-00.png|" Your timetable . "
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s05-00.png|" Don't want to take too much notice of those old timetables , " Ifor said ,
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s05-01.png|reasonably .
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s06-00.png|" Start running punctual and where are you ?
data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s07-00.png|People get

data/segments/m04/m04-043/m04-043-s08-00.png|Very exasperating for one and all . "
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s00-00.png|" And what are you going to do about it ? "
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s01-00.png|Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded .
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s02-00.png|" What do you want me to do ?
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s03-00.png|Send out a sheriff's posse , is it ? "
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s04-00.png|No sense
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s04-01.png|of humour , that Isaiah .
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s05-00.png|He banged down the receiver .
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s06-00.png|Very uncivil .
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s07-00.png|Dropped
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s07-01.png|the mask , now , Ifor did .
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s08-00.png|" Dai Pugh , " he bellowed .
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s09-00.png|" Leap on your bicycle
data/segments/m04/m04-061/m04-061-s09-01.png|and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .

data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s03-00.png|Though Mofydd Owen
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s03-01.png|was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s03-02.png|he still loved her dearly .
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s04-00.png|Already , even
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s04-01.png|as with trembling fingers he fastened his
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s04-02.png|trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s04-03.png|some dreadful ravine , or beset by
data/segments/m04/m04-072/m04-072-s04-04.png|robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency

data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s00-00.png|But even his imagination , luckily for him ,
data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s00-01.png|did not visualise the awful truth - that

data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s00-03.png|the title of " First Woman to Enter Space . "
data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s01-00.png|" Where are we going , Mam ? " inquired little
data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s01-01.png|Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s01-02.png|the fact that the green earth was falling
data/segments/m04/m04-078/m04-078-s01-03.png|away at a rate of knots .
data/segments/m04/m04-081/m04-081-s00-00.png|Where indeed ?
data/segments/m04/m04-081/m04-081-s01-00.png|Megan Thomas spoke sharply
data/segments/m04/m04-081/m04-081-s01-01.png|to the conductor , demanding an explanation .

data/segments/m04/m04-081/m04-081-s07-00.png|Went and consulted the driver .

data/segments/m04/m04-081/m04-081-s09-00.png|" Damned if I know , boy , " said the driver .
data/segments/m04/m04-081/m04-081-s10-00.png|" But something very untoward has

data/segments/m04/m04-093/m04-093-s00-00.png|Immersed in the Dinas Advertiser , was the

data/segments/m04/m04-093/m04-093-s01-00.png|Now he put down his paper ,
data/segments/m04/m04-093/m04-093-s01-01.png|folded it , and glanced idly out of the

data/segments/m04/m04-093/m04-093-s02-00.png|Looked again , eyes starting from

data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s02-01.png|looked down at the fast-disappearing
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s02-02.png|earth , and it seemed to her that she
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s02-03.png|would never see her Dai again .
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s03-00.png|And

data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s03-02.png|regarded this possibility with
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s03-03.png|fortitude , it now filled her with
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s03-04.png|dismay .
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s04-00.png|Quietly she began to
data/segments/m04/m04-107/m04-107-s04-01.png|weep ...
data/segments/m04/m04-113/m04-113-s00-00.png|Dai , meanwhile , was pedalling
data/segments/m04/m04-113/m04-113-s00-01.png|furiously on the road .
data/segments/m04/m04-113/m04-113-s01-00.png|Not a sign of

data/segments/m04/m04-113/m04-113-s03-00.png|At last he caught up Mr. Roberts ,
data/segments/m04/m04-113/m04-113-s03-01.png|walking very dogged towards Llangrwl .

data/segments/n01/n01-020/n01-020-s03-02.png|no permanent image .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s00-00.png|In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s00-01.png|make a direct comparison between the radar
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s00-02.png|image and the ground itself .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s01-00.png|Ahead lay the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s01-01.png|Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s01-02.png|left , Milan .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s02-00.png|The directional angle of the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s02-01.png|scanner could be adjusted to cover any
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s02-02.png|particular area within its range .
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s03-00.png|Geoffrey
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s03-01.png|turned the scale slowly to cover the
data/segments/n01/n01-031/n01-031-s03-02.png|ground immediately ahead .
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s00-00.png|He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s00-01.png|naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s00-02.png|on the clearest night limited angular vision .
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s01-00.png|He glanced
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s01-01.png|at the speed recorder .
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s02-00.png|It seemed almost incredible that
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s02-01.png|the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
data/segments/n01/n01-036/n01-036-s02-02.png|was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s00-00.png|Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s00-01.png|pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s00-02.png|dipped slightly .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s01-00.png|The needle of the speed
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s01-01.png|recorder swung gently through 8.0 , 7.0 , 6.0
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s01-02.png|before coming to rest at 5.0 .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s02-00.png|" We 're a bit
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s02-01.png|ahead of time , " said Alastair .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s03-00.png|" We 'll run
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s03-01.png|in on minimum engine power . "
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s04-00.png|Geoffrey
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s04-01.png|smiled .
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s05-00.png|Alastair talked of running in when
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s05-01.png|they were still more than four hundred
data/segments/n01/n01-045/n01-045-s05-02.png|miles from their destination .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s00-00.png|They were nearing Modena .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s01-00.png|Geoffrey focused the radar scanner
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s01-01.png|on the bridge over the Po , barely forty miles to port .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-00.png|He was able to trace the course of the river ; he
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-01.png|thought he could recognise the route of N12 ,
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-02.png|along which he had motored so desperately little
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s02-03.png|more than twenty-four hours earlier .
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-00.png|Since then
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-01.png|he had flown to England , attended the vital
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-02.png|conference in Bruce Denton's office , been whisked
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-03.png|by special helicopter from the Horse Guards
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-04.png|Parade to Boscombe Down , slept for six blessed
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-05.png|refreshing hours and had now completed two-thirds
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-06.png|of the journey back to the place where every
data/segments/n01/n01-052/n01-052-s03-07.png|indication pointed to Eve being held .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s00-00.png|Geoffrey set himself to consider the
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s00-01.png|movements of the Bentley .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-00.png|It had passed
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-01.png|him at the temporary bridge over the
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-02.png|Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s01-03.png|previous night .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-00.png|He worked out the distance
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-01.png|on the presumption that its route had been
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-02.png|through Florence and Rome and then
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s02-03.png|across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s03-00.png|It came to just over six hundred
data/segments/n01/n01-057/n01-057-s03-01.png|miles .
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s00-00.png|DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s00-01.png|time they docked at Belleray .
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-00.png|And though Guy ,
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-01.png|made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-02.png|speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s01-03.png|the party was over .
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-00.png|Piers came strolling out to
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-01.png|meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-02.png|driven away , invited them casually to come to
data/segments/n02/n02-000/n02-000-s02-03.png|his flat for a drink .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s00-00.png|To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s00-01.png|vengeance .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s01-00.png|She had expected to be met with violent
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s01-01.png|reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s02-00.png|But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s02-01.png|was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-00.png|He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-01.png|own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-02.png|asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
data/segments/n02/n02-004/n02-004-s03-03.png|to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s00-00.png|" I caught him just as he was going to the
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s00-01.png|airport to meet Blanche , " he said .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s01-00.png|" As a matter
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s01-01.png|of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s01-02.png|for me and fetch her .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s02-00.png|He brought her to the party
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s02-01.png|too .
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s03-00.png|They 're both here . "
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s04-00.png|" I didn't know she was
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s04-01.png|coming back from Barbados so soon . "
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s05-00.png|Beryl
data/segments/n02/n02-009/n02-009-s05-01.png|said the first thing that came into her head .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s00-00.png|" Oh , she was due ! "
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s01-00.png|And then he added in the same
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s01-01.png|casual tone ,
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s02-00.png|" She 's not returning to her family .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s03-00.png|She 's
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s03-01.png|going to live with friends of the bank manager , just
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s03-02.png|this side of Belleray . "
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s04-00.png|Mrs. Deane made a suitable
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s04-01.png|comment , but Beryl said nothing .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s05-00.png|She was trying
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s05-01.png|to sort things out in her mind .
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s06-00.png|That beneath his
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s06-01.png|unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
data/segments/n02/n02-016/n02-016-s06-02.png|with anger against her she had no doubt .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s00-00.png|Jack and Blanche were quick to sympathise , and to
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s00-01.png|express their disgust at Sir John's abominable treatment
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s00-02.png|of his guests .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s01-00.png|But Piers remained aloof , and when Beryl
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s01-01.png|suggested having a second party , the following week , he
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s01-02.png|poured cold water on the project .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s02-00.png|Everyone , he declared ,
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s02-01.png|had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s02-02.png|nearly to next week to settle down again .
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-00.png|Meanwhile
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-01.png|Hubert would have betaken himself and his well-
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-02.png|earned gratuity to his native village at the
data/segments/n02/n02-028/n02-028-s03-03.png|north of the island .
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s00-00.png|It was all over and done with .
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-00.png|For the time being Beryl was content to let
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-01.png|it go at that , but she resolved to have
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-02.png|it out with Piers when a reasonable
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s01-03.png|opportunity presented itself .
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-00.png|He must
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-01.png|learn that he could not treat her
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-02.png|with injustice and contempt , ignoring
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-03.png|her explanations as though he were
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-04.png|a schoolmaster and she a small ,
data/segments/n02/n02-033/n02-033-s02-05.png|ignorant child .
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-00.png|He gave her no chance of any private
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-01.png|conversation that evening , for when
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-02.png|Blanche and Jack left , he went with
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s00-03.png|them .
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-00.png|But next morning she insisted
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-01.png|on his taking her out in the jeep -
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-02.png|to find , if possible , Hubert and his
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-03.png|relations , and tell them of
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-04.png|her great disappointment at being
data/segments/n02/n02-037/n02-037-s01-05.png|held up in Balicou .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s00-00.png|With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s00-01.png|Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s00-02.png|beside him .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s01-00.png|" Is that all you want to do ? "
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s01-01.png|he asked , letting in the clutch .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-00.png|" No ; I want
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-01.png|to make you understand just what happened
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-02.png|about this Balicou trip , " she returned
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s02-03.png|coldly .
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s03-00.png|" I 'm a little tired of being treated
data/segments/n02/n02-040/n02-040-s03-01.png|like an ineffective imbecile . "
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s00-00.png|" And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s00-01.png|to account for my manners , " he retorted .
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s01-00.png|" What have I done wrong now ?
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-00.png|I cover up for
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-01.png|you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-02.png|to make the presentation , I run the damned
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-03.png|party to the best of my ability - saying the
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-04.png|sugary things you ought to have been there
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-05.png|to say - and all you can do is to find
data/segments/n02/n02-045/n02-045-s02-06.png|fault . "
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s00-00.png|" It 's your superior attitude that riles me . "
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s01-00.png|Beryl was
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s01-01.png|scarlet with annoyance .

data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s02-01.png|at Balicou doesn't interest you in the faintest degree .

data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s03-01.png|look as though it was only what you expected of me ,
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s03-02.png|as though I didn't care a hoot about letting Hubert
data/segments/n02/n02-049/n02-049-s03-03.png|and his pals down . "
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s00-00.png|" As your employee it 's not my business

data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s00-03.png|stiffly .
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s01-00.png|" Still less to criticise you . "
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s02-00.png|" Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s03-00.png|Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s03-01.png|mounting exasperation .
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s04-00.png|" Very well ! "
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s05-00.png|He
data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s05-01.png|brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough

data/segments/n02/n02-054/n02-054-s06-00.png|" If you want my true opinion I 'll give it .
data/segments/n02/n02-062/n02-062-s00-00.png|You made some sort of a protest to Graybury .

data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s04-00.png|" Maybe I will take a trip with you
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s04-01.png|one of these days , " he said .
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s05-00.png|" In the meantime
data/segments/n04/n04-195/n04-195-s05-01.png|I 'll tell my editor that the story 's a dead bird .
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s00-00.png|Glad I met you .
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s01-00.png|Don't forget to give me a ring -
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s01-01.png|any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? "
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s02-00.png|" I don't know when that will be , " said John .
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s03-00.png|" I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s03-01.png|Master bloody Munyard . "
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s04-00.png|THERE were six submarines ,
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s04-01.png|lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s05-00.png|Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s05-01.png|sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
data/segments/n04/n04-202/n04-202-s05-02.png|charged their electric batteries .
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s00-00.png|A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s00-01.png|through the open windows of the Captain's house .
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-00.png|It
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-01.png|pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-02.png|Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s01-03.png|a substantial breakfast .
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-00.png|Although usually a very
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-01.png|talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-02.png|silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
data/segments/n04/n04-209/n04-209-s02-03.png|some sort .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s00-00.png|There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s00-01.png|affair of Parsifal .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s01-00.png|Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s02-00.png|His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s02-01.png|but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-00.png|It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-01.png|to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-02.png|though in peace time these happenings are few and
data/segments/n04/n04-213/n04-213-s03-03.png|far between .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s00-00.png|This is the testing time for all .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s01-00.png|The affair blows up into
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s01-01.png|a national disaster and then when it is all over life
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s01-02.png|must continue as before .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s02-00.png|During this period the Captain
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s02-01.png|must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s02-02.png|if nothing unusual has happened .
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-00.png|Harry Turton had
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-01.png|written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-02.png|locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-03.png|his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-04.png|usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
data/segments/n04/n04-218/n04-218-s03-05.png|suitable for such occasions .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s00-00.png|He rode down to where I was waiting .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s01-00.png|I was
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s01-01.png|thinking what a skill he had for reading
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s01-02.png|my mind .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s02-00.png|" This would be as good a place
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s02-01.png|for a hold-up as any , " he said , reining in
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s02-02.png|near me .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s03-00.png|" Yes , " I said .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s04-00.png|" It 'll be here to-
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s04-01.png|morrow as likely as not . "
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s05-00.png|I paused .
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s06-00.png|" Miss
data/segments/n06/n06-074/n06-074-s06-01.png|Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . "
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s00-00.png|" Yes , " he said .
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s01-00.png|" I know . "
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s02-00.png|" No harm must come
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s02-01.png|to her , Dan . "
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s03-00.png|" She 'll be all right .
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s04-00.png|It 's the
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s04-01.png|men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s04-02.png|in , Johnny . "
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s05-00.png|" I know .
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s06-00.png|But if lead starts
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s06-01.png|flying she might be in danger . "
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s07-00.png|" That 's so .
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s08-00.png|But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s08-01.png|us to bother with the coach and the folks
data/segments/n06/n06-082/n06-082-s08-02.png|in it . "
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s00-00.png|" Maybe , " I said .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s01-00.png|" But we 've got to remember
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s01-01.png|that girl all the time , Dan .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s02-00.png|I feel kind
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s02-01.png|of responsible for her . "
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s03-00.png|" Of course , " he said ,
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s03-01.png|giving me one of his strange looks .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s04-00.png|Then he
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s04-01.png|turned the conversation .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s05-00.png|" Let 's ride over
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s05-01.png|and have a look at the mining camp .
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s06-00.png|After all it 's them we 're supposed to be
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s06-01.png|working for , as well as the townsfolk and
data/segments/n06/n06-092/n06-092-s06-02.png|the agency detective . "
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s00-00.png|With something of a start I remembered the
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s00-01.png|man who 'd brought us into this business .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s01-00.png|" Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s01-01.png|Dan ? "
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s02-00.png|" Know what ? "
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s03-00.png|" That he 's dead , "
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s03-01.png|I said .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s04-00.png|I watched him because I was always
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s04-01.png|fascinated by the way he looked when you
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s04-02.png|tried to surprise him .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s05-00.png|" Dead ? " he said .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s06-00.png|" Yes .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s07-00.png|Dead .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s08-00.png|Shuffled out of the deck .
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s09-00.png|Blasted
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s09-01.png|down with a shotgun outside the Palace
data/segments/n06/n06-100/n06-100-s09-02.png|last night . "
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s00-00.png|" Fenton or Somers , " he said .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s01-00.png|" Or the Town
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s01-01.png|Marshal , " I added .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s02-00.png|His face was fixed ,
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s02-01.png|unreadable as a rock .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s03-00.png|" Let 's get over to the
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s03-01.png|mining camp , " he said abruptly .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s04-00.png|He wheeled
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s04-01.png|his horse back off the trail and up the slope
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s04-02.png|leading to the ridge .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s05-00.png|I followed .
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s06-00.png|From the
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s06-01.png|top you could see something of the wild hill
data/segments/n06/n06-111/n06-111-s06-02.png|country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s00-00.png|The air was fresh and clear and you
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s00-01.png|could see far over west and north for many
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s00-02.png|miles .
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s01-00.png|The real high country of the Rockies
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s01-01.png|lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s01-02.png|colour drawing .
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s02-00.png|Between us and that lay
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s02-01.png|a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
data/segments/n06/n06-119/n06-119-s02-02.png|malpais .
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s00-00.png|" The mine-workings lie north of the town , "
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s00-01.png|said Dan .
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s01-00.png|" If we head west we ought to
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s01-01.png|cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . "
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-00.png|So we swung west , making slow going over
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-01.png|rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-02.png|into draws , circling a big mesa by a
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s02-03.png|four or five mile valley , sandy-floored .
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-00.png|It
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-01.png|got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-02.png|gratefully by a small creek where we watered
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-03.png|the horses and drank enough to cure our
data/segments/n06/n06-123/n06-123-s03-04.png|thirst .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s00-00.png|An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s00-01.png|we figured would lead to the miners' camp .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s01-00.png|We turned north into it and after about four
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s01-01.png|miles it led into a small canyon which
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s01-02.png|opened out into a wide shallow draw .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s02-00.png|Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s02-01.png|the miners at work .
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s03-00.png|They were scattered
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s03-01.png|over a fairly wide area working singly or
data/segments/n06/n06-128/n06-128-s03-02.png|in pairs .
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s00-00.png|We didn't approach unchallenged .
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-00.png|Just short
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-01.png|of the diggings there was a roughly-built
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-02.png|shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s01-03.png|out ,
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s02-00.png|" If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s02-01.png|your whiskers off . "
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s03-00.png|" Take it easy , mister , " I sang
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s03-01.png|out .
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s04-00.png|" We don't aim to come any closer and we 've
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s04-01.png|got no whiskers so as you can see .
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s05-00.png|Just you
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s05-01.png|go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk
data/segments/n06/n06-133/n06-133-s05-02.png|to him about what happened last night . "
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s00-00.png|" Oh , " said the unseen guard .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s01-00.png|He blew a
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s01-01.png|whistle then , loud and shrill .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s02-00.png|The gun barrel
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s02-01.png|peeking out through a hole in the shack never
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s02-02.png|wavered .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s03-00.png|We sat our horses , waiting .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s04-00.png|" Looks as
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s04-01.png|though they 're expecting trouble , " I said .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s05-00.png|" Where
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s05-01.png|there 's gold and women there 's always trouble , "
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s05-02.png|observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle .
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s06-00.png|He
data/segments/n06/n06-140/n06-140-s06-01.png|was never long on patience .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s00-00.png|I saw several men running down towards
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s00-01.png|the shack .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s01-00.png|They were all armed with rifles .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s02-00.png|As the nearest of them came round the
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s02-01.png|shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s02-02.png|Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s03-00.png|He
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s03-01.png|came up close , eyeing us suspiciously .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s04-00.png|" We 've
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s04-01.png|come 2a-calling , " I said .
data/segments/n06/n06-148/n06-148-s05-00.png|" Can't see no reason

data/segments/n06/n06-156/n06-156-s01-00.png|We dismounted and

data/segments/n06/n06-175/n06-175-s03-00.png|I paused and watched my

data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s00-01.png|you could see they were hard hit .
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-00.png|They were
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-01.png|simple men who knew a lot maybe about
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-02.png|digging for gold but were babes in arms
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-03.png|when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-04.png|desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
data/segments/n06/n06-182/n06-182-s01-05.png|rest .

data/segments/n06/n06-201/n06-201-s00-02.png|on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
data/segments/n06/n06-201/n06-201-s00-03.png|handsome offer so I chimed in too .

data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s00-00.png|Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s00-01.png|of the church where there was a small open
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s00-02.png|outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s00-03.png|and forks and tidying up implements .
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s01-00.png|It might

data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s03-00.png|He entered , and seated himself
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s03-01.png|in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow .
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s04-00.png|His curious headgear fell off .
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s05-00.png|Strange things
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s05-01.png|were going on in his bewildered brain .
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-00.png|When
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-01.png|a man was drowning and towards his last

data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-03.png|life came up before him in some cinematic
data/segments/p01/p01-147/p01-147-s06-04.png|kind of sequence .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s00-00.png|Mr. Copthorne was on dry land in a church
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s00-01.png|outbuilding , but this was happening to him now .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s01-00.png|He
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s01-01.png|saw himself as a sulky , ugly , malformed , repressed
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s01-02.png|boy , then a young youth .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s02-00.png|He saw himself refusing
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s02-01.png|baptism according to the sect his parents belonged to .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s03-00.png|Walking out of the chapel later on .
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-00.png|Continuing
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-01.png|on , his leaping mind flashed pictures of chi-
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-02.png|canery and corruption , the growth of the dea-
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-03.png|dly decadence and absorption in debase-
data/segments/p01/p01-155/p01-155-s04-04.png|ment and Satanic debauchery .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s00-00.png|He didn't know what to make of it , but it
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s00-01.png|was Mr. Copthorne all right .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s01-00.png|Perhaps he had
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s01-01.png|been attending some kind of fancy dress do
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s01-02.png|in London .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s02-00.png|Very strange his eyes looked .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s03-00.png|Mad ,
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s03-01.png|hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s03-02.png|his head , so the verger described afterwards .
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s04-00.png|" You 're very early about , sir , " he said , trying to
data/segments/p01/p01-168/p01-168-s04-01.png|speak normally .

data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-00.png|I travelled down from London

data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-02.png|the thought came to me I 'd like
data/segments/p01/p01-174/p01-174-s01-03.png|to take a look at the church .

data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s00-00.png|There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was

data/segments/p02/p02-000/p02-000-s04-00.png|The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the

data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s01-01.png|went quickly back to fetch them .

data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s02-01.png|off the plane with him were talking .
data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s03-00.png|He was writing something in his

data/segments/p02/p02-008/p02-008-s03-02.png|of despair Gay knew that of course
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s00-00.png|Gay , sitting opposite Gavin on the terrace could
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s00-01.png|hardly believe that she was the same girl ,

data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s01-00.png|Gavin raised his glass to her and smiled
data/segments/p02/p02-017/p02-017-s01-01.png|and Gay's heart turned over .

data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s02-00.png|He gestured towards the bay where the full

data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s02-02.png|laid his hand on hers .
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-00.png|Gay smiled at him
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-01.png|again , happy beyond belief , knowing that
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-02.png|now Gavin was in love with her and her
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-03.png|only , yet remembering for a second the
data/segments/p02/p02-022/p02-022-s03-04.png|kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s00-00.png|All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her .

data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s01-01.png|would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s01-02.png|look the other way if need be .
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s02-00.png|" I say ! "
data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s03-00.png|Gavin was looking over her

data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s05-00.png|Gay glanced behind her ,

data/segments/p02/p02-027/p02-027-s06-01.png|lovely , she 's French , a very well known model I believe .

data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s00-01.png|to the bar .
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s01-00.png|Doc and Lilyan were
data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s01-01.png|sitting just inside having coffee .

data/segments/p02/p02-069/p02-069-s03-01.png|Lilyan remonstrated .

data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s00-00.png|Gay thanked him and walked out on to
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s00-01.png|the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s00-02.png|had bought a drink and taken it outside .
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s01-00.png|She looked round scanning the tables ,
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s01-01.png|then caught her breath , a cold hand
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s01-02.png|seeming to clutch her heart .
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s02-00.png|Gavin was
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s02-01.png|seated at a small table in a shadowy
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s02-02.png|corner talking animatedly to Simone .
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s03-00.png|As Gay watched he offered the girl a
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s03-01.png|cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
data/segments/p02/p02-076/p02-076-s03-02.png|hers in an intimate way .
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-00.png|Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-01.png|decided to go back and join Lilyan and
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-02.png|Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-03.png|run upstairs to her room , knowing that
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-04.png|Gavin although he had told her that he
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-05.png|loved her , was already flirting with a girl
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s00-06.png|that he had only met a few minutes before .
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s01-00.png|Larry's advice flashed through her mind ,
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s01-01.png|but she turned away , giving a little
data/segments/p02/p02-081/p02-081-s01-02.png|gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-00.png|The others were all dancing and
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-01.png|as Gay drew out a chair and sat
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-02.png|down Gavin , without a word , swept
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s00-03.png|Simone on to the floor .
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-00.png|" It doesn't mean
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-01.png|anything , " Gay told herself desperately ,
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-02.png|trying to understand Gavin's point of
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-03.png|view and remembering the advice
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-04.png|that Larry had given her , while she
data/segments/p02/p02-090/p02-090-s01-05.png|felt wretched beyond words .
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s00-00.png|His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s00-01.png|taste but it was unkind beyond words .
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-00.png|She fumbled
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-01.png|with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-02.png|not wanting to smoke but needing some action
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s01-03.png|to help her control her feelings .
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-00.png|" Come and
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-01.png|dance , " Doc's cheery voice came as a
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-02.png|lifeline and Gay got up quickly , mana-
data/segments/p02/p02-101/p02-101-s02-03.png|ging a smile .
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s00-00.png|As he swung her on to the floor Gay saw Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s00-01.png|and Simone go through the doorway that led
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s00-02.png|down to the beach .
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s01-00.png|Gay closed her eyes for a
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s01-01.png|moment in disgust .
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-00.png|She was fully aware that Gavin
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-01.png|would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-02.png|and no doubt he would come back soon and
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-03.png|after Simone had left expect her to accept his
data/segments/p02/p02-105/p02-105-s02-04.png|kisses on the way back to the hotel .

data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-02.png|feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
data/segments/p02/p02-135/p02-135-s00-03.png|people were talking about the way Gavin

data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-01.png|watched the workmen constructing
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-02.png|the roundabout , which was
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-03.png|to put St. John's Casualty Department
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-04.png|out of operation - in theory , at
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s01-05.png|least .
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s02-00.png|She would think of her-
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s02-01.png|self as a stranger in these parts
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s02-02.png|studying these cross-roads .
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s03-00.png|Which
data/segments/p03/p03-004/p03-004-s03-01.png|one to take ?
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-00.png|" If I were a tramp I would simply blow a
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-01.png|feather , " she decided , rather envying the gentle-
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-02.png|man of the road his freedom of decision , and
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-03.png|wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-04.png|women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s00-05.png|airy directions accordingly .
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s01-00.png|" If I were needing a
data/segments/p03/p03-009/p03-009-s01-01.png|job I 'd go to London , of course , " she went on .
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s00-00.png|" There are all sorts of wonder-
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s00-01.png|ful jobs in London and I could
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s00-02.png|take my pick , whereas in Yarmouth
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s00-03.png|one has to know something about fishing
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s00-04.png|and in Liverpool they 'd want sea-farers .
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s01-00.png|I don't think I 'd go to Edinburgh un-
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s01-01.png|less I was a Scot and wanting to get
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s01-02.png|home , or perhaps a student studying to
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s01-03.png|be a doctor , and I already know
data/segments/p03/p03-012/p03-012-s01-04.png|all about that . "
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s00-00.png|She was engaged to Nigel , had been for two years .
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-00.png|Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " ,
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-01.png|and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-02.png|a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s01-03.png|evening ,
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s02-00.png|" If we get married , old girl , you 'll have to stop
data/segments/p03/p03-023/p03-023-s02-01.png|that lark , I can tell you ! "
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-00.png|She couldn't remember what they had been talking about or
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-01.png|which ' lark ' she would have to stop , only that significant tiny
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-02.png|word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-03.png|with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-04.png|which now took on an ominous significance : Nigel had been
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-05.png|seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-06.png|been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
data/segments/p03/p03-027/p03-027-s00-07.png|Little Phelpham .
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-00.png|Now Nigel had every right to go where he
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-01.png|liked during his off-duty periods
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-02.png|when she was not free ; this much they had
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s00-03.png|conceded one to the other .
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-00.png|They rarely
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-01.png|found they were off duty together , and
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-02.png|the situation would have been intolerable
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-03.png|had there not been some give and take
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s01-04.png|about their relationship .
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s02-00.png|So when Nigel
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s02-01.png|had told her about taking Luke's
data/segments/p03/p03-029/p03-029-s02-02.png|evening surgery she had said ,
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s00-00.png|" Bless you !
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s01-00.png|I hope Luke is suitably grateful , darling . "
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s02-00.png|" Oh , well , "
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s02-01.png|he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work .
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s03-00.png|One gets plenty
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s03-01.png|of variety and it 's a change . "
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s04-00.png|Nigel was the hospital's
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s04-01.png|Junior Medical Officer .
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s05-00.png|" You won't be free about nine , I
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s05-01.png|suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? " she had
data/segments/p03/p03-033/p03-033-s05-02.png|asked hopefully .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s00-00.png|" Hardly likely , my sweet .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s01-00.png|Luke's surgery goes on for
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s01-01.png|hours .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s02-00.png|If they get in before eight-thirty , even
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s02-01.png|though they 're standing on one another's toes ,
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s02-02.png|I 've got to see 'em .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s03-00.png|If I am free , though ,
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s03-01.png|I 'll give you a ring , O.K. ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s04-00.png|O.K. , " she had
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s04-01.png|replied readily .
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-00.png|So how could Nigel have
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-01.png|been at the Load of Trouble roadhouse ,
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-02.png|dancing with a blonde at eight-thirty that
data/segments/p03/p03-040/p03-040-s05-03.png|very evening ?
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s00-00.png|" No , " she told Phil Gubbins , a junior
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s00-01.png|houseman , " it wasn't Nigel you saw ,
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s00-02.png|my lad . "
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s01-00.png|" It was Nigel's car , anyway .
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s02-00.png|NUF 121 . "
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s03-00.png|" He probably loaned his car
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s03-01.png|to somebody , Phil .
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s04-00.png|He 's always doing that . "
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s05-00.png|Young Gubbins shrugged .
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s06-00.png|" I didn't see his
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s06-01.png|face , Di , but it certainly looked like
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s06-02.png|Nigel from the back .
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s07-00.png|D.j. and all .
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s08-00.png|Of course such as I couldn't afford
data/segments/p03/p03-047/p03-047-s08-01.png|to go into the Load of Trouble . "
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s00-00.png|" Neither can Nigel , " smiled Diana .
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s01-00.png|" He 's saving up to get married .
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s02-00.png|Remember ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s03-00.png|" I remember , " quipped the houseman ,
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s03-01.png|meaning no offence , " but does he ?
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s04-00.png|That blonde was something . "
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s05-00.png|" Anybody
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s05-01.png|I know ? " she smiled .
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s06-00.png|" I think so .
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s07-00.png|I got a good look at her .
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s08-00.png|But if Nigel
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s08-01.png|wasn't there it isn't important , is it ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s09-00.png|" No , " Di said immediately .
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s10-00.png|" It isn't at
data/segments/p03/p03-057/p03-057-s10-01.png|all important . "
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-00.png|But after that slight slip of the tongue on Nigel's part she had
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-01.png|realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-02.png|was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s00-03.png|made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s01-00.png|" Nigel , " she had besought him , " you know that evening
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s01-01.png|you took Luke Parson's surgery and there was a woman
data/segments/p03/p03-069/p03-069-s01-02.png|with a cyst on her ear ... ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s00-00.png|" 5Ye-es ? " he lowered his eyes and kissed her on the
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s00-01.png|mouth , an act of devotion he didn't over-indulge .
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s01-00.png|" What about it , my sweet ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s02-00.png|" Well , " she laughed
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s02-01.png|suddenly in an upsurging of relief , " that stupid
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s02-02.png|Gubbins boy thought he saw you at the Load of Trouble .
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s03-00.png|With a blonde , too .
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s04-00.png|Imagine ! "
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s05-00.png|Nigel was frowning .
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s06-00.png|He
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s06-01.png|looked distinguished when he frowned ; boyishly
data/segments/p03/p03-072/p03-072-s06-02.png|handsome at other times .
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s00-00.png|" Gubbins ?
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s01-00.png|Gubbins ? " he fretted .
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s02-00.png|" Who 's he ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-00.png|Though Diana knew the name of every
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-01.png|member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-02.png|Nigel often had to think hard to sort
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s03-03.png|them out .
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s04-00.png|" He 's the carrotty lad , isn't he ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s04-01.png|he now demanded .
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s05-00.png|" What was he
data/segments/p03/p03-080/p03-080-s05-01.png|doing at the Load of Trouble ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s00-00.png|" Oh , he wasn't .
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s01-00.png|His motor-bike had
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s01-01.png|broken down outside and he noticed
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s01-02.png|your car and then you dancing with
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s01-03.png|this blonde . "
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s02-00.png|" Really ? " Nigel cocked
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s02-01.png|one eyebrow .
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s03-00.png|" Actually she was brunette
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s03-01.png|at the roots and I had a redhead on
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s03-02.png|the other arm .
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s04-00.png|He would have told
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s04-01.png|you this , too ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s05-00.png|" No , " she laughed .
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s06-00.png|" He didn't actually see you .
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s07-00.png|Because
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s07-01.png|it was your car I suppose he
data/segments/p03/p03-087/p03-087-s07-02.png|presumed it was you , all dressed up in
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s00-00.png|" My white or my black ? " Nigel enquired .
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s01-00.png|" Now I wonder which I wore at that
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s01-01.png|particular surgery ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s02-00.png|" You are a fool ,
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s02-01.png|darling , " Di said happily .
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s03-00.png|" I shall take
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s03-01.png|great pleasure in telling that young man

data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s03-03.png|evening . "
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s04-00.png|" No , don't , " he said , after
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s04-01.png|kissing her again .
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s05-00.png|" I rather like to have
data/segments/p03/p03-096/p03-096-s05-01.png|the housemen think of me as a

data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s02-01.png|couldn't believe it .

data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s03-01.png|was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .
data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s04-00.png|" You need your holiday , darling .
data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s05-00.png|I only
data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s05-01.png|wish I could go with you ! "

data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s06-01.png|Wills , if you 're making improper suggestions ... ? "
data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s07-00.png|" It would make me more interesting ,
data/segments/p03/p03-103/p03-103-s07-01.png|I suppose ? " she enquired archly .
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s00-00.png|" No , it wouldn't ! " he almost snapped ,
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s00-01.png|surprising her .
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s01-00.png|" You sounded like some-
data/segments/p03/p03-112/p03-112-s01-01.png|body else for a moment there .

data/segments/p03/p03-135/p03-135-s00-00.png|Her figure was small and exquisite , like a schoolgirl's still , and

data/segments/p03/p03-158/p03-158-s02-01.png|of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took

data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s02-00.png|" Why ? " he
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s02-01.png|enquired , combing his thick , tawny hair .

data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s05-01.png|he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s05-02.png|which really hurt .
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-00.png|" Without your ring it 's just like
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-01.png|kissing somebody else's girl , " he decided wickedly ,
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-02.png|and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
data/segments/p03/p03-173/p03-173-s06-03.png|receive a sharp slap for his pains .

data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-04.png|which had followed her slim young figure
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s00-05.png|out of his sight .

data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-01.png|decided with a sigh of satisfaction , and
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-02.png|then regarded the ring which he retrieved
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s01-03.png|from his pocket .
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s02-00.png|" At a price , " he concluded ,
data/segments/p03/p03-181/p03-181-s02-01.png|with some bitterness .

data/segments/p03/p03-185/p03-185-s01-03.png|room , which proved the elasticity of medical commitments .
data/segments/p03/p03-185/p03-185-s02-00.png|Something had cropped up which required Nigel's attention ,
data/segments/p03/p03-185/p03-185-s02-01.png|she was convinced , or he would have granted her small request

data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s03-00.png|It was a new briefcase , and as the train jogged along
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s03-01.png|the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil .
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s04-00.png|He wondered what it contained .
data/segments/r02/r02-038/r02-038-s05-00.png|Probably the remains

data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s00-00.png|It was locked .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s01-00.png|Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s01-01.png|when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s01-02.png|of wads of paper .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s02-00.png|' Cor ! ' he muttered aloud , ' there 's

data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s03-00.png|He felt in his jacket pocket
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s03-01.png|and pulled out a key ring .
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s04-00.png|In succession he tried
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s04-01.png|his own briefcase key , a suitcase key and a
data/segments/r02/r02-054/r02-054-s04-02.png|device designed to lock typewriters .
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s00-00.png|Cecil searched in his pockets once
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s00-01.png|more and came up with two

data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-00.png|After a few seconds
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-01.png|of twisting , he roughly thrust a

data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s01-03.png|waggled it around vigorously .
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s02-00.png|There was a click and the

data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-00.png|Cecil thrust an
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-01.png|eager hand inside , his fingers
data/segments/r02/r02-060/r02-060-s03-02.png|groping after wads of five

data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s00-00.png|They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with

data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s01-01.png|rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one

data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s02-00.png|' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s02-01.png|tried to recall if they were still legal tender .
data/segments/r02/r02-065/r02-065-s03-00.png|Surely the

data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s00-00.png|Cecil frowned in disappointment as he focussed upon the

data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s00-02.png|at all .
data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s01-00.png|He was holding a paper booklet , the top sheet of which

data/segments/r02/r02-070/r02-070-s02-01.png|glowered at his own breach of social morality .

data/segments/r06/r06-022/r06-022-s00-00.png|This was strange , even magic , because the owner's

data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s02-00.png|We had a morning at Pierre's .

data/segments/r06/r06-027/r06-027-s06-00.png|During this period he wrote a book ,

data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-00.png|There was a front-page rear-attack on de

data/segments/r06/r06-041/r06-041-s00-02.png|to murders , apart for an outcry against a

data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-02.png|pellets were easily removed and the
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-03.png|labourer was able to return to work the
data/segments/r06/r06-053/r06-053-s02-04.png|same afternoon .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s00-00.png|We travelled down to Nice on the Lambretta .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s01-00.png|You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s01-01.png|way .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-00.png|In the middle of the journey is a
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-01.png|valley with a sea of vines and olives
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-02.png|and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s02-03.png|the hoe .
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-00.png|Rising from the flecked sea are
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-01.png|islands tapering to shipwrecked castles and
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-02.png|towns , grey , rose-headed mariners clinging
data/segments/r06/r06-057/r06-057-s03-03.png|like limpets to the rock .
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s00-00.png|There is a curd of morning smoke and
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s00-01.png|a muffled bell taps the sky .
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s01-00.png|Here we
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s01-01.png|stopped , as in fine weather we always
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s01-02.png|stopped .
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-00.png|Down below is the village of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-01.png|Cagnes , but between are pockets of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-02.png|heat and cold like the hands of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-03.png|friends or strangers , and a flurry of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-04.png|early smells , the dark bosoms of
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-05.png|beech and the thin pine fingers
data/segments/r06/r06-062/r06-062-s02-06.png|kissed by the sun .
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s00-00.png|Then here was Nice , and the old holiday
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s00-01.png|sea , blue as a new school exercise
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s00-02.png|book .
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-00.png|The same old Nice , creamy ,
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-01.png|vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-02.png|the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-03.png|prostitutes , edging past grubby grandeur
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s01-04.png|to the old sleeping port .
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-00.png|This , and
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-01.png|Paris , were my ruined pavilions , and I
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-02.png|could catch the taste of dead dreams on
data/segments/r06/r06-066/r06-066-s02-03.png|my tongue like spray .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s00-00.png|We parked the Lambretta opposite the
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s00-01.png|Negresco , and went to the beach to
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s00-02.png|have a swim .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s01-00.png|Amazing bedlam rocked
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s01-01.png|in our eyes .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s02-00.png|The sea boiled with waves ,
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s02-01.png|they galloped to the walls and spumed
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s02-02.png|over the Promenade des Anglais .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s03-00.png|A huge
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s03-01.png|crowd had collected .
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-00.png|There were firemen
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-01.png|and policemen and ambulances , and the
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-02.png|eyes of the spectators were hard with
data/segments/r06/r06-070/r06-070-s04-03.png|disaster .
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-00.png|They all had that neat look of
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-01.png|Mediterranean people to whom nothing
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-02.png|could ever happen , the chosen sane , the
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-03.png|uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-04.png|disease and accident by doctors , God and
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s00-05.png|the municipality .
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-00.png|Yet , at any time now ,
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-01.png|the bell would ring for them - the gilded
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-02.png|love house , the mad grandmother or the
data/segments/r06/r06-076/r06-076-s01-03.png|bloody child at the crossroads .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s00-00.png|It was growing cold .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s01-00.png|We left the
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s01-01.png|crowd and drove back to Vence .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s02-00.png|The cool evening perfumes stood
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s02-01.png|beckoning at the corners of the roads .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-00.png|Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-01.png|organs were impaired years ago ) , and
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-02.png|I had to explain the low , sharp and
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s03-03.png|sweet signals in the air .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s04-00.png|When we
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s04-01.png|got back home we felt exhausted .
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s05-00.png|London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,
data/segments/r06/r06-090/r06-090-s05-01.png|mingled with the memory of sandwiches
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s00-00.png|We went straight to bed and slept until
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s00-01.png|the turtle-doves drummed up the
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s00-02.png|sun .
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s01-00.png|The next morning , in the square
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s01-01.png|opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s01-02.png|beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s02-00.png|Mart had been right , the body had been
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s02-01.png|a woman's .
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s03-00.png|It belonged to a Madame
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s03-01.png|N.
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-00.png|Enquiries had been made in the
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-01.png|neighbourhood , and it transpired that
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-02.png|Madame N's husband had made an
data/segments/r06/r06-097/r06-097-s04-03.png|arrangement with the dead lady's sister
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-00.png|The sister , able to swim , had returned
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-01.png|to the shore , but instead of returning
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-02.png|to her brother-in-law ( with whom
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-03.png|she had an illicit relationship ) , she
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-04.png|went to her fiance*?2's house and
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s00-05.png|confessed everything .
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s01-00.png|Her fiance*?2
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s01-01.png|reported her to the police , and then jumped
data/segments/r06/r06-103/r06-103-s01-02.png|off a cliff near Monte Carlo .
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-00.png|The day I promised to take Catherine
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-01.png|down to visit my young friend Philip
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-02.png|at his school in the country , we were
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-03.png|to leave at eleven , but she arrived
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s00-04.png|at nine .
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s01-00.png|Her blue dress was new ,
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s01-01.png|and so were her fashionable shoes .
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s02-00.png|Her
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s02-01.png|hair had just been done .
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s03-00.png|She looked
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s03-01.png|more than ever like a pink and gold
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s03-02.png|Renoir girl who expects everything from
data/segments/r06/r06-106/r06-106-s03-03.png|life .
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s00-00.png|Catherine lives in a white house
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s00-01.png|overlooking the sweeping brown tides
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s00-02.png|of the river .
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-00.png|She helped me clean up my
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-01.png|flat with a devotion which said that
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-02.png|she felt small flats were altogether more
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s01-03.png|romantic than large houses .
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-00.png|We drank
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-01.png|tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-02.png|being 15 , has pure stern tastes in every-
data/segments/r06/r06-111/r06-111-s02-03.png|thing from food to music .
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-00.png|Catherine looked at the books lying
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-01.png|around his room , and asked if she
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-02.png|might borrow the stories of Isaac Babel
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s00-03.png|to read on the train .
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s01-00.png|Catherine is 13 .
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s02-00.png|I suggested she might find them dif-
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s02-01.png|ficult , but she said ,
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s03-00.png|' Philip reads them ,
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s03-01.png|doesn't he ? '
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-00.png|During the journey I read
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-01.png|newspapers and watched her pretty
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-02.png|frowning face as she turned the
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-03.png|pages of Babel , for she was determined
data/segments/r06/r06-115/r06-115-s04-04.png|to let nothing get between her and
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-00.png|At the school , which is charming , ci-
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-01.png|vilised and expensive , the two children
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-02.png|walked together across green fields , and
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-03.png|I followed , seeing how the sun gilded
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-04.png|their bright friendly heads turned
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s00-05.png|towards each other as they talked .
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s01-00.png|In
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s01-01.png|Catherine's left hand she carried the
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s01-02.png|stories of Isaac Babel .
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s02-00.png|After lunch we
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s02-01.png|went to the pictures .
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s03-00.png|Philip allowed
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s03-01.png|# it to be seen that he thought going to
data/segments/r06/r06-121/r06-121-s03-02.png|the pictures just for the fun of it was
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s00-00.png|For his sake we chose the more
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s00-01.png|serious of the two films that were
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s00-02.png|showing in the little town .
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s01-00.png|It was
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s01-01.png|about a good priest who helped cri-
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s01-02.png|minals in New York .
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-00.png|His goodness , how-
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-01.png|ever , was not enough to prevent one
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-02.png|of them from being sent to the gas
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-03.png|chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-04.png|Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-05.png|crying and could face the light of a golden
data/segments/r06/r06-126/r06-126-s02-06.png|evening .
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s00-00.png|At the entrance of the cinema the
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s00-01.png|doorman was lying in wait for anyone
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s00-02.png|who had red eyes .
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s01-00.png|Grasping Catherine
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s01-01.png|by her suffering arm , he said bitterly :
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s02-00.png|' Yes , why are you crying , he had to be
data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s02-01.png|punished for his crime , didn't he ? '

data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s03-01.png|rine stared at him , incredulous .

data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s04-01.png|rescued her by saying with disdain :

data/segments/r06/r06-130/r06-130-s05-01.png|even when its demonstrated to them . '
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-00.png|The doorman turned his attention
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-01.png|to the next red-eyed emerger from the

data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-03.png|the station , the children silent because
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s00-04.png|of the cruelty of the world .
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s01-00.png|Finally Catherine
data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s01-01.png|said , her eyes wet again :

data/segments/r06/r06-137/r06-137-s03-00.png|And Philip said :

data/segments/r06/r06-143/r06-143-s00-00.png|In the train going back to London I sat
